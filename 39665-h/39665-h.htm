<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>Ever since entering Great Britain, about the year 1506, the
Gipsies have been drawing into their body the blood of the ordinary
inhabitants and conforming to their ways; and so prolific has
the race been, that there cannot be less than 250,000 Gipsies of all
castes, colours, characters, occupations, degrees of education, culture,
and position in life, in the British Isles alone, and possibly
double that number. There are many of the same race in the
United States of America. Indeed, there have been Gipsies in
America from nearly the first day of its settlement; for many of
the race were banished to the plantations, often for very trifling
offences, and sometimes merely for being by &#8220;habit and repute
Egyptians.&#8221; But as the Gipsy race leaves the tent, and rises to
civilization, it hides its nationality from the rest of the world, so
great is the prejudice against the name of Gipsy. In Europe and
America together, there cannot be less than 4,000,000 Gipsies in
existence. John Bunyan, the author of the celebrated <i>Pilgrim&#8217;s
Progress</i>, was one of this singular people, as will be conclusively
shown in the present work. The philosophy of the existence of
the Jews, since the dispersion, will also be discussed and established
in it.</p>

<p>When the &#8220;wonderful story&#8221; of the Gipsies is told, as it ought
to be told, it constitutes a work of interest to many classes of readers,
being a subject unique, distinct from, and unknown to, the rest
of the human family. In the present work, the race has been treated
of so fully and elaborately, in all its aspects, as in a great measure
to fill and satisfy the mind, instead of being, as heretofore, little
better than a myth to the understanding of the most intelligent
person.</p>

<p>The history of the Gipsies, when thus comprehensively treated,
forms a study for the most advanced and cultivated mind, as well
as for the youth whose intellectual and literary character is still to
be formed; and furnishes, among other things, a system of science
not too abstract in its nature, and having for its subject-matter the
strongest of human feelings and sympathies. The work also seeks
to raise the name of Gipsy out of the dust, where it now lies;
while it has a very important bearing on the conversion of the
Jews, the advancement of Christianity generally, and the development
of historical and moral science.</p>

<h2>EDITOR&#8217;S PREFACE.</h2>

<hr class="c25" />

<p>This work should have been introduced to the world
long ere now. The proper time to have brought it forward
would have been about twenty years ago,<a name="FNanchor2" id="FNanchor2"></a><a href="#Footnote2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> when the subject
was nearly altogether new, and when popular feeling, in
Scotland especially, ran strongly toward the body it treats
of, owing to the celebrity of the writings of the great Scottish
novelist, in which were depicted, with great truthfulness,
some real characters of this wayward race. The inducements
then to hazard a publication of it were great; for by
bringing it out at that time, the author would have enjoyed,
in some measure, the sunshine which the fame of that great
luminary cast around all who, in any way, illustrated a subject
on which he had written. But for Sir Walter Scott&#8217;s
advice&mdash;an advice that can only be appreciated by those
who are acquainted with the vindictive disposition which
the Gipsies entertain toward those whom they imagine
to have injured them&mdash;our author would have published a
few magazine articles on the subject, when the tribe would
have taken alarm, and an end would have been made to
the investigation. The dread of personal danger, there is
no doubt, formed a considerable reason for the work being
so long withheld from the public: at the same time, our
author, being a timid and nervous man, not a little dreaded
the spleen of the party opposed to the literary society with
which he identified himself, and the idea of being made the
subject of one of the slashing criticisms so characteristic of
the times. But now he has descended into the tomb, with
most of his generation, where the abuse of a reviewer or
the ire of a wandering Egyptian cannot reach him.</p>

<p>Since this work was written there has appeared one by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Mr. Borrow, on the <i>Gitanos</i> or Spanish Gipsies. In the
year 1838, a society was formed in Scotland, under the
patronage of the Scottish Church, for the reformation of
the wandering portion of the body in that country, with
some eminent men as a committee of management, among
whom was a reverend gentleman of learning, piety, and
worth, who said that he himself was a Gipsy, and whose
fine swarthy features strongly marked the stock from which
he was descended. There are others in that country of a
like origin, ornaments to the same profession, and many in
other respectable walks of life, of whom I will speak in
my <a href="#Page_371">Disquisition</a> on the Gipsies, at the end of the work.</p>

<p>Although a few years have elapsed since the principal
details of this work were collected, the subject cannot be
considered as old. The body in Scotland has become more
numerous since the downfall of Napoleon; but the improved
system of internal order that has obtained since that period,
has so very much suppressed their acts of depredation and
violence toward the community, and their savage outbursts
of passion toward those of their own race who had offended
them, that much which would have met with only a slight
punishment before, or in some instances been passed over, as
a mere Gipsy scuffle, would now be visited with the utmost
penalty the law could inflict. Hence the wild spirit, but not
the number, of the body has been very much crushed.
Many of them have betaken themselves to regular callings
of industry, or otherwise withdrawn from public observation;
but, in respect to race, are as much, at heart, Gipsies
as before. Many of the Scottish wandering class have
given way before an invasion of swarms of Gipsies from
Ireland.</p>

<p>It is almost unnecessary to give a reason why this work
has been introduced here, instead of the country in which
it was written, and of which, for the most part, it treats.
Suffice it to say, that, having come to this country, I have
been led to bring it out here, where it may receive, sooner
or later, more attention from those at a distance from the
place and people it treats of, than from those accustomed to
see and hear of them daily, to many of whom they appear
as mere vagabonds; it being a common feature in the
human mind, that that which comes frequently under our
observation is but little thought of, while that at a distance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and unknown to us, forms the subject of our investigations
and desires.<a name="FNanchor3" id="FNanchor3"></a><a href="#Footnote3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> In taking this view of the subject, the language
of Dr. Bright may be used, when he says: &#8220;The
condition and circumstances of the Gipsy nation throughout
the whole of Europe, may truly be considered amongst the
most curious phenomena in the history of man.&#8221; And
although this work, for the most part, treats of Scottish
Gipsies, it illustrates the history of the people all over
Europe, and, it may be said, pretty much over the world;
and affords materials for reflection on so singular a subject
connected with the history of our common family, and so
little known to mankind in general. To the American
reader generally, the work will illustrate a phase of life and
history with which it may be reasonably assumed he is not
much conversant; for, although he must have some knowledge
of the Gipsy race generally, there is no work, that I
am aware of, that treats of the body like the present. To
all kinds of readers the words of the celebrated Christopher
North, as quoted in the author&#8217;s <a href="#Page_55">Introduction</a>, may be
addressed:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;Few things more sweetly vary civil life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than a barbarian, savage Tinkler<a name="FNanchor4" id="FNanchor4"></a><a href="#Footnote4"
class="fnanchor" style="font-size: 90%;">[4]</a> tale.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is a singular circumstance that, until comparatively
lately, little was known of this body in Scotland, beyond
their mere existence, and the depredations which they committed
on their neighbours; no further proof of which need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
be given than a reference to the letters of Sir Walter
Scott and others, in the <a href="#Page_55">Introduction</a> to the work, and the
avidity with which the few articles of our author in Blackwood&#8217;s
Magazine were read.</p>

<p>The higher we may rise in the scale of general information
and philosophic culture, the greater the attractions
will this moral puzzle have for our contemplation&mdash;the phenomenon
of a barbarous race of men, free as the air, with
little but the cold earth for a bed, and the canopy of heaven
for a covering, obtruding itself upon a civilized community,
and living so long in the midst of it, without any material
impression being made on the habits of the representative
part of it; the only instance of the kind in the modern
history of the world. In this solitary case, having nothing
from which to reason analogously as to the result, observation
alone must be had recourse to for the solution of the
experiment. It is from this circumstance that the subject,
in all its bearings, has been found to have such charms for
the curious and learned; being, as it were, a study in history
of the most interesting kind. It may be remarked
that Professor Wilson, the Christopher North of Blackwood,
is said to have accompanied some of the tribe in their
peregrinations over parts of England and Wales. Without
proceeding to the same length, our author, in his own
peculiar way, prosecuted his researches with much indefatigability,
assiduity, and patience. He kept an open house
for them at all times, and presented such allurements as the
skillful trapper of vermin will sometimes use in attracting
the whole in a neighbourhood; when if one Gipsy entered,
many would follow; although he would generally find them
so shy in their communications as sometimes to require years
of such baiting to ensure them for the elucidation of a
single point of their history. In this way he made himself
appear, in his associations with them, as very odd, and perhaps
not of very sound mind, in the estimation of the wise
ones around him.</p>

<p>The popular idea of a Gipsy, at the present day, is very
erroneous as to its extent and meaning. The nomadic
Gipsies constitute but a portion of the race, and a very
small portion of it. A gradual change has come over their
outward condition, all over Europe, from about the commencement
of the first American war, but from what time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
previous to that, we have no certain data from which to
form an opinion. In the whole of Great Britain they have
been very much mixed with the native blood of the country,
but nowhere, I believe, so much so as in Scotland. There
is every reason to suppose that the same mixture has taken
place in Europe generally, although its effects are not so
observable in the southern countries&mdash;from the circumstance
of the people there being, for the most part, of dark hair
and complexion&mdash;as in those lying further toward the north.
But this circumstance would, to a certain extent, prevent the
mixture which has taken place in countries the inhabitants
of which have fair hair and complexions. The causes
leading to this mixture are various.</p>

<p>The persecutions to which the Gipsies were exposed,
merely for being Gipsies, which their appearance would
readily indicate, seem to have induced the body to intermarry
with our race, so as to disguise theirs. That would
be done by receiving and adopting males of our race,
whom they would marry to females of theirs, who would
bring up the children of such unions as members of their
fraternity. They also adopted the practice to give their
race stamina, as well as numbers, to contend with the people
among whom they lived. The desire of having servants,
(for Gipsies, generally, have been too proud to do menial
work for each other,) led to many children being kidnapped,
and reared among them; many of whom, as is customary
with Oriental people, rose to as high a position in the tribe
as any of themselves.<a name="FNanchor5" id="FNanchor5"></a><a href="#Footnote5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Then again, it was very necessary to have people of fair
complexion among them, to enable them the more easily to
carry on their operations upon the community, as well as to
contribute to their support during times of persecution. Owing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to these causes, and the occasional occurrence of white
people being, by more legitimate means, received into their
body, which would be more often the case in their palmy days,
the half, at least, of the Scottish Gipsies are of fair hair and
blue eyes. Some would naturally think that these would
not be Gipsies, but the fact is otherwise; for, owing to the
dreadful prejudice which has always attached to the name
of Gipsy, these white and parti-coloured Gipsies, imagining
themselves, as it were, banished from society, on account of
their descent, cling to their Gipsy connection; as the other
part of their blood, they imagine, will not own them. They
are Gipsies, and, with the public, they think that is quite
enough. They take a pride in being descended from a race
so mysterious, so ancient, so universal, and cherish their
language the more from its being the principal badge of
membership that entitles them to belong to it. The nearer
they approach the whites as regards blood, the more acutely
do they feel the antipathy which is entertained for their race,
and the more bitter does the propinquity become to them. The
more enlightened they become, the stronger becomes their
attachment to the sept in the abstract, although they will
despise many of its members. The sense of such an ancient
descent, and the possession of such an ancient and secret
language, in the minds of men of comparatively limited
education and indifferent rearing, brought up in humble
life, and following various callings, from a tinker upward,
and even of men of education and intelligence, occupying
the position of lawyers, medical doctors, and clergymen,
possess for them a charm that is at once fascinating and
enchanting. If men of enlightened minds and high social
standing will go to such lengths as they have done, in their
endeavours to but look into their language, how much more
will they not cling to it, such as it is, in whose hearts it
is? Gipsies compounded for the most part of white blood,
but with Gipsy feelings, are, as a general thing, much
superior to those who more nearly approach what may
be called the original stock; and, singularly enough, speak
the language better than the others, if their opportunities
have been in any way favourable for its acquisition.</p>

<p>The primitive, original state of the Gipsies is the tent and
tilted cart. But as any country can support only a limited
number in that way, and as the increase of the body is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
large, it follows that they must cast about to make a
living in some other way, however bitter the pill may be
which they have to swallow. The nomadic Gipsy portion
resembles, in that respect, a water trough; for the water
which runs into it, there must be a corresponding quantity
running over it. The Gipsies who leave the tent resemble
the youth of our small seaports and villages; for there,
society is so limited as to compel such youth to take to the
sea or cities, or go abroad, to gain that livelihood which the
neighbourhood in which they have been reared denies to
them. In the same manner do these Gipsies look back to
the tent from which they, or their fathers, have sprung.
They carry the language, the associations, and the sympathies
of their race, and their peculiar feelings toward the
community, with them; and, as residents of towns, have
generally greater facilities, from others of their race residing
near them, for perpetuating their language, than when strolling
over the country.</p>

<p>The prejudice of their fellow creatures, which clings to
the race to which they belong, almost overwhelms some of
them at times; but it is only momentary; for such is the
independence and elasticity of their nature, that they rise
from under it, as self-complacent and proud as ever. They
in such cases resort to the <i>tu quoque</i>&mdash;the <i>tit for tat</i> argument
as regards their enemies, and ask, &#8220;What is this white
race, after all? What were their forefathers a few generations
ago? the Highlands a nest of marauding thieves, and
the Borders little better. Or society at the present day&mdash;what
is it but a compound of deceit and hypocrisy? People
say that the Gipsies steal. True; some of them steal
chickens, vegetables, and such things; but what is that compared
to the robbery of widows and orphans, the lying and
cheating of traders, the swindling, the robberies, the murders,
the ignorance, the squalor, and the debaucheries of so
many of the white race? What are all these compared to
the simple vices of the Gipsies? What is the ancestry
they boast of, compared, in point of antiquity, to ours?
People may despise the Gipsies, but they certainly despise
all others not of their own race: the veriest beggar Gipsy,
without shoes to his feet, considers himself better than the
queen that sits upon the throne. People say that Gipsies
are blackguards. Well, if some of them are blackguards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
they are at least illustrious blackguards as regards descent,
and so in fact; for they never rob each other, and far less
do they rob or ruin those of their own family.&#8221; And they
conclude that the odium which clings to the race is but a
prejudice. Still, they will deny that they are Gipsies, and
will rather almost perish than let any one, not of their own
race, know that they speak their language in their own
households and among their own kindred. They will even
deny or at least hide it from many of their own race.</p>

<p>For all these reasons, the most appropriate word to apply
to modern Gipsyism, and especially British Gipsyism, and
more especially Scottish Gipsyism, is to call it a caste, and a
kind of masonic society, rather than any particular mode
of life. And it is necessary that this distinction should be
kept in mind, otherwise the subject will appear contradictory.</p>

<p>The most of these Gipsies are unknown to the public as
Gipsies. The feeling in question is, for the most part, on
the side of the Gipsies themselves; they think that more
of them is known than actually is. In that respect a kind
of nightmare continually clings to them; while their peculiarly
distant, clannish, and odd habits create a kind of
separation between them and the other inhabitants, which
the Gipsy is naturally apt to construe as proceeding from a
different cause. Frequently, all that is said about them
amounts only to a whisper among some of the families in
the community in which they live, and which is confidentially
passed around among themselves, from a dread of
personal consequences. Sometimes the native families say
among themselves, &#8220;Why should we make allusion to their
kith and kin? They seem decent people, and attend
church like ourselves; and it would be cruel to cast up
their descent to them, and damage them in the estimation
of the world. Their cousins, (or second cousins, as it may
be,) travel the country in the old Tinkler fashion, no doubt;
but what has that to do with them?&#8221; The estimate of such
people never, or hardly ever, goes beyond the simple idea
of their being &#8220;descended from Tinklers;&#8221; few have the
most distant idea that they are Gipsies, and speak the
Gipsy language among themselves. It is certain that a
Gipsy can be a good man, as the world goes, nay, a very
good man, and glory in being a Gipsy, but not to the public.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
He will adhere to his ancient language, and talk it in his
own family; and he has as much right to do so, as, for example,
a Highlander has to speak Gaelic in the Lowlands,
or when he goes abroad, and teach it to his children. And
he takes a greater pride in doing it, for thus he reasons:
&#8220;What is English, French, Gaelic, or any other living language,
compared to mine? Mine will carry me through
every part of the known world: wherever a man is to be
found, there is my language spoken. I will find a brother
in every part of the world on which I may set my foot; I
will be welcomed and passed along wherever I may go.
Freemasonry indeed! what is masonry compared to the
brotherhood of the Gipsies? A language&mdash;a whole language&mdash;is
its pass-word. I almost worship the idea of
being a member of a society into which I am initiated by
my blood and language. I would not be a man if I did not
love my kindred, and cherish in my heart that peculiarity
of my race (its language) which casts a halo of glory
around it, and makes it the wonder of the world!&#8221;</p>

<p>The feeling alluded to induces some of these Gipsies to
change their residences or go abroad. I heard of one
family in Canada, of whom a Scotchman spoke somewhat in
the following way: &#8220;I know them to be Gipsies. They
remind me of a brood of wild turkeys, hatched under a tame
bird; it will take the second or third descent to bring
them to resemble, in some of their ways, the ordinary barn-door
fowl. They are very restless and queer creatures, and
move about as if they were afraid that every one was going
to tramp on their corns.&#8221; But it is in large towns they feel
more at home. They then form little communities among
themselves; and by closely associating, and sometimes
huddling together, they can more easily perpetuate their
language, as I have already said, than by straggling, twos
or threes, through the country. But their quarrelsome disposition
frequently throws an obstacle in the way of such
associations. Secret as they have been in keeping their
language from even being heard by the public while wanderers,
they are much more so since they have settled in
towns.</p>

<p>The origin of the Gipsies has given rise, in recent times,
to many speculations. The most plausible one, however,
seems to be that they are from Hindostan; an opinion our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
author supports so well, that we are almost bound to acquiesce
in it. In these controversies regarding the origin of
the Gipsies, very little regard seems to have been had to
what they say of themselves. It is curious that in every
part of Europe they have been called, and are now called,
Egyptians. No trace can now be found of any enquiry made
as to their origin, if such there was made, when they first
appeared in Europe. They seem then to have been taken
at their word, and to have passed current as Egyptians.
But in modern times their country has been denied them,
owing to a total dissimilarity between their language and
any of the dialects of modern Egypt. A very intelligent
Gipsy informed me that his race sprung from a body of
men&mdash;a cross between the Arabs and Egyptians&mdash;that left
Egypt in the train of the Jews.<a name="FNanchor6" id="FNanchor6"></a><a href="#Footnote6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> In consulting the record
of Moses, I find it said, in Ex. xii. 38, &#8220;and a mixed multitude
went up also with them&#8221; (the Jews, out of Egypt).
Very little is said of this mixed multitude. In Lev. xxiv.
10, mention is made of the son of an Israelitish woman, by
an Egyptian, being stoned to death for blasphemy, which
would almost imply that a marriage had taken place previous
to leaving Egypt. After this occurrence, it is said in
Num. xi. 4, &#8220;and the mixed multitude that was among
them fell a lusting&#8221; for flesh. That would imply that they
had not amalgamated with the Jews, but were only among
them. The Scriptures say nothing of what became of this
mixed multitude after the Jews separated from them (Neh.
xiii. 3), and leave us only to form a conjecture relative to
their destiny.</p>

<p>We naturally ask, what could have induced this mixed
multitude to leave Egypt? and the natural reply is, that
their motive was the same that led to the exodus of the
Jews&mdash;a desire to escape from slavery. No commentator
that I have read gives a plausible reason for the mixed
multitude leaving Egypt with the Jews. Scott, besides
venturing four suppositions, advances a fifth, that
&#8220;some left because they were distressed or discontented.&#8221;
But that seems to fall infinitely short of the true reason.
Adam Clark says, &#8220;Probably they were refugees who came
to sojourn in Egypt, because of the dearth which had obliged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
them to emigrate from their own countries.&#8221; But that
dearth occurred centuries before the time of the exodus; so
that those refugees, if such there were, who settled in Egypt
during the famine, could have returned to their own countries
generations before the time of that event. Scott
says, &#8220;It is probable some left Egypt because it was desolate;&#8221;
and Henry, &#8220;Because their country was laid waste
by the plagues.&#8221; But the desolation was only partial; for
we are told that &#8220;He that feared the word of the Lord
among the servants of Pharaoh, made his servants and his
cattle flee into the houses;&#8221; by which means they escaped
destruction from the hail, which affected only those remaining
in the field. We are likewise told that, although the
barley and flax were smitten by the same hail-storm, the
wheat and rye, not being grown up, were left untouched.
These two latter (besides fish, roots and vegetables) would
form the staples of the food of the Egyptians; to say nothing
of the immense quantities in the granaries of the country.
If the Egyptians could not find bread in their own country,
how were they to obtain it by accompanying the Jews into
a land of which they knew nothing, and which had to be
conquered before it could be possessed? Where were they
to procure bread to support them on the journey, if it was
not to be had at home?</p>

<p>The other reasons given by these commentators for the
departure of the mixed multitude from Egypt are hardly
worth controverting, when we consider the social manners
and religious belief of the Egyptians. We are told that,
for being shepherds, the Israelites were an abomination
unto the Egyptians (Gen. xlvi. 34); and that the Egyptians
considered it an abomination to eat bread with a Hebrew,
(Gen. xliii. 32,) so supreme was the reign of caste and of
nationality at that period in Egypt. The sacrifices of the
Jews were also an abomination to the Egyptians (Ex. viii.
26). The Hebrews were likewise influenced by feelings
peculiar to themselves, which would render any alliances
or even associations between them and their oppressors
extremely improbable; but if such there should have been,
the issue would be incorporated with the Hebrews.</p>

<p>There could thus be no personal motive for any of the
Egyptians to accompany the Hebrews; and as little could
there be of that which pertains to the religious; for, as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
people, they had become so &#8220;vain in their imaginations,&#8221;
and had &#8220;their foolish hearts so darkened,&#8221; as to worship
almost every created thing&mdash;bulls, birds, serpents, leeks,
onions and garlic. Such a people were almost as well nigh
devoid of a motive springing from a sense of elevated religion,
as were the beasts, the reptiles and the vegetables
which they worshipped. A miracle performed before the
eyes of such a people would have no more salutary or lasting
influence than would a flash of lightning before the
eyes of many a man in every day life; it might prostrate
them for a moment, but its effects would be as transitory.
Like the Jews themselves, at a subsequent time, they might
credit the miracle to Beelzebub, the prince of devils; and,
like the Gergesenes, rise up in a body and beseech Moses
and his people to &#8220;depart out of their coasts.&#8221; Indeed,
after the slaying of the first-born of the Egyptians, we are
told that &#8220;the Egyptians were urgent upon the people that
they might send them out of the land in haste; for, they
said, We be all dead men.&#8221; Considering how hard a matter
it was for Moses to urge the Jews to undertake the
exodus; considering their stiff-necked and perverse grumbling
at all that befell them; notwithstanding that to them
&#8220;pertained the fathers, the adoption, the glory and the
covenant;&#8221; the commands and the bones of Joseph; the
grievous bondage they were enduring, and the almost daily
recourse to which Moses had for a miracle to strengthen
their faith and resolution to proceed; and we will perceive
the impossibility of the &#8220;mixed multitude&#8221; leaving Egypt
on any ground of religion.</p>

<p>This principle might even be urged further. If we consider
the reception which was given to the miracles of
Christ as &#8220;a son over his own house, and therefore worthy
of more glory than Moses, who was but a servant,&#8221; we will
conclude that the miracles wrought by Moses, although personally
felt by the Egyptians, would have as little lasting
effect upon them as had those of the former upon the
Jews themselves; they would naturally lead to the Hebrews
being allowed to depart, but would serve no purpose of inducing
the Egyptians to go with them. For if a veil was
mysteriously drawn over the eyes of the Jews at the advent
of Christ, which, in a negative sense, hid the Messiah from
them (Mark iv. 11, 12; Matt. xi. 25, 26; and John xii. 39,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
40), how much more might it not be said, &#8220;He hath blinded
their eyes, and hardened their hearts, that they should not
see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts,&#8221; and
let the people of Israel go, &#8220;till they would thrust them out
hence altogether;&#8221; and particularly so when the object of
Moses&#8217; mission was to redeem the Israelites from the bondage
of Egypt, and spoil and smite the Egyptians.</p>

<p>The only reasonable conclusion to which we can come, as
regards a motive for the &#8220;mixed multitude&#8221; leaving Egypt
along with the Jews, is, that being slaves like themselves,
they took advantage of the opportunity, and slipped out with
them.<a name="FNanchor7" id="FNanchor7"></a><a href="#Footnote7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The Jews, on being reduced to a state of bondage, were
employed by Pharaoh to &#8220;build treasure cities, and work
in mortar and brick, and do all manner of service in the
field,&#8221; besides being &#8220;scattered abroad through all the land
of Egypt, to gather stubble in place of straw,&#8221; wherewith to
make their tale of bricks. In this way they would come
much in contact with the other slaves of the country; and,
as &#8220;adversity makes strange bed-fellows,&#8221; they would naturally
prove communicative to their fellow-sufferers, and
expatiate on the history of their people, from the days of
Abraham downward, were it only from a feeling of vanity
to make themselves appear superior to what they would consider
the ordinary dross around them. They would also
naturally allude to their future prospects, and the positive
promise, or at least general idea, which they had of their
God effecting their deliverance, and leading them into a
country (Gen. 1. 24, 25) where all the miseries they were
then enduring would be forgotten. They would do that
more especially after Moses had returned from his father-in-law
in Midian, to bring them out of Egypt; for we are told,
in Ex. iv. 29-31, that the elders of the children of Israel
were called together and informed of the intended redemption,
and that all the people believed. By such means as
these would the minds of some of the other slaves of Egypt
be inflamed at the very idea of freedom being perhaps in
immediate prospect for so many of their fellow-bondsmen.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Thereafter happened the many plagues; the causes of
which must have been more or less known to the Egyptians
generally, from the public manner in which Moses would
make his demands (Ex. x. 7); and consequently to their
slaves; for many of the slaves would be men of intelligence,
as is common in oriental countries. Some of these slaves
would, in all probability, watch, with fear and trembling, the
dreadful drama played out (Ex. ix. 20). Others would, perhaps,
give little heed to the various sayings of the Hebrews
at the time they were uttered; the plagues would, perhaps,
have little effect in reminding them of them. As they experienced
their effects, they might even feel exasperated toward
the Hebrews for being the cause of them; still it is
more probable that they sympathized with them, as fellow-bondsmen,
and murmured against Pharaoh for their existence
and greater manifestation. But the positive order, nay
the entreaty, for the departure of the Israelites, and the
passage before their eyes of so large a body of slaves to obtain
their freedom, would induce many of them to follow
them; for they would, in all likelihood, form no higher
estimate of the movement than that of merely gaining that
liberty which slaves, in all nations, and under all circumstances,
do continually sigh after.</p>

<p>The character of Moses alone was a sufficient guarantee
to the slaves of Egypt that they might trust themselves to
his leadership and protection (not to speak of the miraculous
powers which he displayed in his mission); for we are told
that, besides being the adopted son of Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter,
he was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and
mighty in word and deed. Having been, according to Josephus,
a great commander in the armies of Egypt, he must
have been the means of reducing to bondage many of the
slaves, or the parents of the slaves, then living in Egypt. At
the time of the exodus we are told that he was &#8220;very great
in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh&#8217;s servants, and
in the sight of the people&#8221; (Ex. xi. 3). The burying of the
&#8220;first-born&#8221; was not a circumstance likely to prevent a slave
gaining his freedom amid the dismay, the moaning, and
groaning, and howling throughout the land of Egypt. The
circumstance was even the more favourable for his escape,
owing to the Hebrews being allowed to go, till it pleased
God again to harden and stir up Pharaoh to pursue them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
(Ex. xiv. 2-5 and 8), in order that his host might be overthrown
in the Red Sea.</p>

<p>The Jews, while in Egypt, seem to have been reduced to
a state of serfdom only&mdash;crown slaves, not chattels personal;
which would give them a certain degree of respect in the
eyes of the ordinary slaves of the country, and lead them,
owing to the dignity of their descent, to look down with
disdain upon the &#8220;mixed multitude&#8221; which followed them.
While it is said that they were &#8220;scattered over the land of
Egypt,&#8221; we are told, in Ex. ix. 4, that the murrain touched
not the cattle of Israel; and in the 26th verse, that &#8220;in the
land of Goshen, where the people of Israel were, there was
no hail.&#8221; And Moses said to Pharaoh, &#8220;Our cattle also shall
go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for
thereof we must take to serve the Lord our God&#8221; (Ex. x. 26).
From this we would naturally conclude, that such of the
Jews only as were capable of work, were scattered over the
land of Egypt to do the work of Pharaoh, while the rest
were left in the land of Goshen. By both the Egyptians
and their slaves, the Hebrews would be looked upon as a
mysterious people, which the former would be glad to send
out of the land, owing to the many plagues which they had
been the cause of being sent upon them; and while they got
quit of them, as they did, there would be no earthly motive
for the Egyptians to follow them, through a wilderness, into
a country of which the Hebrews themselves knew nothing.
But it would be different with their slaves; they had everything
to hope from a change of condition, and would readily
avail themselves of the chance to effect it.</p>

<p>The very term &#8220;mixed multitude&#8221; implies slaves; for the
Hebrew word <i>hasaphsuph</i>, as translated by Bochartus, means
<i>populi colluvies undecunque collecta</i>&mdash;&#8220;the dregs or scum of
the people gathered together from all parts.&#8221; But this interpretation
is most likely the literal meaning of a figurative
expression, which was intended to describe a body of men
such as the slaves of Egypt must have been, that is, a mixture
that was compounded of men from almost every part of
the world known to the Egyptians; the two principal ingredients
of which must have been what may be called the
Egyptian and Semitic. Moses seems to have used the word in
question in consequence of the vexation and snare which the
mixed multitude proved to him, by bringing upon the camp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of his people the plague, inflicted, in consequence of their
sins, in the midst of them. At the same time the Hebrews
were very apt to term &#8220;dregs and scum&#8221; all who did not
proceed from the loins of their father, Abraham. But I am
inclined to believe that the bulk or nucleus of the mixed
multitude would consist of slaves who were located in Goshen,
or its neighbourhood, when the Jews were settled
there by Pharaoh. These would be a mixture of the shepherd
kings and native Egyptians, held by the former as
slaves, who would naturally fall into the hands of the Egyptian
monarch during his gradual reconquest of the country;
and they would be held by the pure Egyptians in as little
esteem as the Jews themselves, both being, in a measure, of
the shepherd race. In this way it may be claimed that the
Gipsies are even descendants of the shepherd kings.</p>

<p>After leaving Egypt, the Hebrews and the &#8220;mixed multitude,&#8221;
in their exuberance of feeling at having gained their
freedom, and witnessed the overthrow of their common oppressor
in the Red Sea, would naturally have everything in
common, till they regained their powers of reflection, and
began to think of their destiny, and the means of supporting
so many individuals, in a country in which provisions could
hardly be collected for the company of an ordinary caravan.
Then their difficulties would begin. It was enough for
Moses to have to guide the Hebrews, whose were the promises,
without being burdened and harassed by those who followed
them. Then we may reasonably assume that the
mixed multitude began to clamour for flesh, and lead the
Hebrews to join with them; in return for which a plague
was sent upon the people. They were unlikely to submit to
be led by the hand of God, and be fed on angels&#8217; food, and,
like the Hebrews, leave their carcasses in the wilderness;
for their religious sentiments, if, as slaves of Egypt, they
had religious sentiments, would be very low indeed, and
would lead them to depend upon themselves, and leave the
deserts of Arabia, for some other country more likely to
support them and their children. Undoubtedly the two
people then separated, as Abraham and Lot parted when
they came out of Egypt.</p>

<p>How to shake off this mixed multitude must have caused
Moses many an anxious thought. Possibly his father-in-law,
Jethro, from the knowledge and sagacity which he displayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
in forming the government of Moses himself, may have
assisted him in arriving at the conclusion which he must
have so devoutly wished. To take them into the promised
land with him was impossible; for the command of God,
given in regard to Ishmael, the son of Abraham, by Hagar
the Egyptian, and which was far more applicable to the
mixed multitude, must have rung in his ears: &#8220;Cast out
this bondwoman and her son, for the son of this bondwoman
shall not be heir with my son, Isaac;&#8221; &#8220;for in Isaac shall
thy seed be called.&#8221; As slaves of Egypt they would not
return to that country; they would not go north, for that
was the heritage of the people of Israel, which had to be
wrested from the fierce tribes of Palestine; they would not
go north-east, for there lay the powerful empire of Assyria,
or the germs out of which it sprung; they could not go
south, for the ocean hemmed them in, in that direction; and
their only alternative was to proceed east, through Arabia
Petrea, along the gulf of Persia, through the Persian
desert, into northern Hindostan, where they formed the
Gipsy caste, and whence they issued, after the lapse of so
many centuries, in possession of the language of Hindostan,
and spread themselves over the earth. What a strange
sensation passes through the mind, when such a subject is
contemplated! Jews and Gipsies having, in a sense, the
same origin, and, after such vicissitudes, meeting each
other, face to face, under circumstances so greatly alike, in
almost every part of the world, upward of 3000 years after
they parted company. What destiny awaited the Jews
themselves on escaping from Egypt? They had either to
subdue and take the place of some other tribe, or be reduced
to a state of slavery by it and perhaps others combined; or
they might possibly have been befriended by some great
empire as tributaries; or failing these three, what remained
for them was the destiny that befell the Gipsies.</p>

<p>On leaving Egypt, the Gipsies would possess a common
language, which would hold them together as a body; as
slaves under the society of an Egyptian monarchy, they
would have few, if any, opinions of a religious nature; and
they would have but little idea of the laws of <i>meum</i> and
<i>tuum</i>. The position in which they would find themselves
placed, and the circumstances surrounding them, would
necessitate them to rob, steal, or appropriate whatever they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
found to be necessary to their existence; for whether they
turned to the right hand or to the left, they would always
find territory previously occupied, and property claimed by
some one; so that their presence would always be unwelcome,
their persons an intrusion everywhere; and having
once started on their weary pilgrimage, as long as they
maintained their personal independence, they would never
attain, as a body, to any other position than they have done,
in popular estimation, for the last four hundred and fifty
years in Europe.</p>

<p>In entering Hindostan they would meet with a civilized
people, governed by rigid caste, where they would have no
alternative but to remain aloof from the other inhabitants.
Then, as now, that country had many wandering tribes
within its borders, and for which it is peculiarly favourable.
Whatever might have been the amount of civilization which
some of the Gipsies brought with them from Egypt, it could
not be otherwise than of that <i>quasi</i> nature which generally
characterizes that of slaves, and which would rapidly degenerate
into a kind of barbarism, under the change of circumstances
in which they found themselves placed. As runaway
slaves, they would naturally be shy and suspicious, and
be very apt to betake themselves to mountains, forests and
swamps, and hold as little intercourse with the people of
the country in which they were, as possible. Still, having
been reared within a settled and civilized state, they would
naturally hang around some other one, and nestle within it,
if the face of the country, and the character and ways of
the people, admitted of it. Having been bondsmen, they
would naturally become lazy after gaining their freedom,
and revel in the wild liberty of nature. They would do
almost anything for a living rather than work; and whatever
they could lay their hands on would be fairly come by,
in their imagination. But to carry out this mode of life,
they would naturally have recourse to some ostensible employment,
to enable them to travel through the country, and
secure the toleration of its inhabitants. Here their Egyptian
origin would come to their assistance; for as slaves of
that country, they must have had many among them who
would be familiar with horses, and working in metals, for
which ancient Egypt was famous; not to speak of some of
the occult sciences which they would carry with them from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
that country. In the first generation their new habits and
modes of life would become chronic; in the second generation
they would become hereditary; and from this strange
phenomenon would spring a race that is unique in the history
of the human family. What origin could be more worthy
of the Gipsies? What origin more philosophical?</p>

<p>Arriving in India a foreign caste, the Gipsies would
naturally cling to their common origin, and speak their common
language, which, in course of ages, would be forgotten,
except occasional words, which would be used by them as
catch-words. At the present day my Gipsy acquaintances
inform me that, in Great Britain, five out of every ten of
their words are nothing but common Hindostanee. How
strange would it be if some of the other words of their
language were those used by the people of Egypt under the
Pharaohs. Mr. Borrow says: &#8220;Is it not surprising that the
language of <i>Petulengro</i>, (an English Gipsy,) is continually
coming to my assistance whenever I appear to be at a loss
with respect to the derivation of crabbed words. I have
made out crabbed words in &AElig;schylus by means of his
speech; and even in my Biblical researches I have derived
no slight assistance from it.&#8221; &#8220;Broken, corrupted and half
in ruins as it is, it was not long before I found that it was
an original speech, far more so, indeed, than one or two
others of high name and celebrity, which, up to that time,
I had been in the habit of regarding with respect and veneration.
Indeed, many obscure points connected with the
vocabulary of these languages, and to which neither classic
nor modern lore afforded any clue, I thought I could now
clear up by means of this strange, broken tongue, spoken
by people who dwell among thickets and furze bushes, in
tents as tawny as their faces, and whom the generality of
mankind designate, and with much semblance of justice, as
thieves and vagabonds.&#8221;</p>

<p>A difficulty somewhat similar to the origin of the Gipsies
has been started in reference to their language; whether it
is a speech distinct from any other surrounding it, or a few
slang words or expressions connected together by the usual
languages of the countries in which the race is to be found.
The slightest consideration will remove the doubt, and lead
us to the former conclusion. It is true there must needs be
some native words mixed up with it; for what language, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
ancient or modern times, has come down free of a mixture
with others? If that be the case with languages classified,
written, and spoken in a community, with no disturbing element
near it to corrupt it, is it to be expected that the
speech of a people like the Gipsies can be free of similar
additions or substitutions, when it possesses none of these
advantages for the preservation of its entirety and purity?
From the length of time the people have been in Europe,
and the frequency of intercourse which they have been
forced by circumstances, in modern times especially, to have
with its natives, it would appear beyond measure surprising
that even a word of their language is spoken at all. And
this fact adds great weight to Sir Walter Scott&#8217;s remark,
when he says that &#8220;their language is a great mystery;&#8221; and
to that of Dr. Bright, when he speaks of its existence as
being &#8220;little short of the miraculous.&#8221; But when we consider,
on strictly philosophical principles, the phenomenon of
the perpetuation of the Gipsy language, we will find that
there is nothing so very wonderful about it after all. The
race have always associated closely and exclusively together;
and their language has become to them like the worship of
a household god&mdash;hereditary, and is spoken among themselves
under the severest of discipline. It is certain that it
is spoken at the present day, by some of the race, nearly as
well as the Gaelic of many of the immediate descendants
of the emigrants in some of the small Highland settlements
in America, when it has not been learned by book, even to
the extent of conversing on any subject of ordinary life,
without apparently using English words. But, as is common
with people possessing two languages, the Gipsies often use
them interchangeably in expressing the smallest idea. Besides
the way mentioned by which the Gipsy language has
been corrupted, there is another one peculiar to all speeches,
and which is, that few tongues are so copious as not to stand
in need of foreign words, either to give names to things or
wants unknown in the place where the language originated,
or greater meaning or elucidation to a thing than it is capable
of; and pre&euml;minently so in the case of a barbarous
people, with few ideas beyond the commonest wants of daily
life, entering states so far advanced toward that point of
civilization which they have now reached. But the question
as to the extent of the Gipsy language never can be conclusively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
settled, until some able philologist has the unrestricted
opportunity of daily intercourse with the race; or,
as a thing more to be wished than obtained, some Gipsy
take to suitable learning, and confer a rarity of information
upon the reader of history everywhere: for the attempt
at getting a single word of the language from the Gipsies,
is, in almost every case, impracticable. Sir Walter Scott
seems to have had an intention of writing an account of the
Gipsies himself; for, in a letter to Murray, as given by
Lockhart, he writes: &#8220;I have been over head and ears in
work this summer, or I would have sent the Gipsies; indeed
I was partly stopped by finding it impossible to procure a
few words of their language.&#8221; For this reason, the words
furnished in this work, although few, are yet numerous,
when the difficulties in the way of getting them are considered.
Under the chapter of Language will be found
some curious anecdotes of the manner in which these were
collected.</p>

<p>Of the production itself little need be said. Whatever
may be the opinion of the public in regard to it, this may be
borne in mind, that the collecting of the materials out of
which it is formed was attended with much trouble, and no
little expense, but with a singular degree of pleasure, to the
author; and that but for the urgent and latest request of
him whom, when alive or dead, Scotchmen have always delighted
to honour, it might never have assumed its present
form. It is what it professes to be&mdash;a history, in which the
subject has been stripped of everything pertaining to fiction
or even colouring; so that the reader will see depicted, in
their true character, this singular people, in the description
of whom, owing to the suspicion and secrecy of their nature,
writers generally have indulged in so much that is trifling
and even fabulous.</p>

<p>Such as the work is, it is offered as a contribution toward
the filling up of that void in literature to which Dr. Bright
alludes, in the introduction to his travels in Hungary, when,
in reference to Hoyland&#8217;s Survey, and some scattered notices
of the Gipsies in periodicals, he says: &#8220;We may hope at
some time to collect, satisfactorily, the history of this extraordinary
race.&#8221; It is likewise intended as a response to the
call of a writer in Blackwood, in which he says: &#8220;<i>Our</i> duty
is rather to collect and store up the <i>raw materials</i> of literature&mdash;to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
gather into our repository scattered facts, hints and
observations&mdash;which more elaborate and learned authors
may afterwards work up into the dignified tissue of history
or science.&#8221;</p>

<p>I deem it proper to remark that, in editing the work, I
have taken some liberties with the manuscript. I have, for
example, recast the <a href="#Page_55">Introduction</a>, re-arranged some of the
materials, and drawn more fully, in some instances, upon the
author&#8217;s authorities; but I have carefully preserved the
facts and sentiments of the original. I may have used some
expressions a little familiar and perhaps not over-refined in
their nature; but my excuse for that is, that they are illustrative
of a subject that allows the use of them.</p>

<h2>EDITOR&#8217;S INTRODUCTION</h2>

<hr class="c25" />

<p>The discovery and history of barbarous races of men, besides
affording exquisite gratification to the general mind of
civilized society, have always been looked upon as important
means toward a right understanding of the history of our
species, and the relation in which it stands to natural and
revealed theology; and in their prosecution have produced,
in latter times, many instances of the most indefatigable disinterestedness
and greatest efforts of true courage of which
our nature is capable; many, in the person of the traveller,
philanthropist and missionary, cheerfully renouncing in their
pursuit every comfort of civilized life, braving death itself
in every variety of form, and leaving their bones on the distant
shore, or far away in the unknown interior of the dreary
continent, without a trace of their fate to console those most
dearly attached to them. The result of the discoveries
hitherto made has invariably confirmed the conclusions of a
few superior minds, formed without the assistance drawn
from such a source, that under whatever circumstances man
is placed, and whatever advantages he may enjoy, there is
very little real difference between the characters, intrinsically
considered, of the savage and man in what is considered
a civilized community. There is this difference between what
may be called barbarism, not unfrequently to be met with in
a civilized community, springing from the depravity natural
to man, and what obtains in a barbarous tribe or nation as
such, that, in the former, it forms the exception; the brother,
the father, or the son of the person of it often exhibiting the
most opposite nature and conduct; while, in the latter, it
forms the rule, and what the individual cannot, in a sense,
avoid. But, in making this distinction, is there nothing to be
found within the former sphere somewhat anomalous to the
position thus presented?</p>

<p>The subject of the following enquiry forms the exception,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and from its being the only instance to be met with in the
history of Europe, it may be said to merit the greatest consideration
of the statesman, the historian, the philosopher,
and the Christian.</p>

<p>It does not appear possible, from the peculiar mould in
which the European mind has been cast, for it to have remained
in that state of immobility which, from the remotest
antiquity, seems to have characterized that of Asia; in which
continent society has remained torpid and inactive, contented
with what it has inherited, without making any effort at
change or advancement. This peculiarity of character, in
connexion with the influences of the Christian religion, seems
to have had the effect of bringing about that thorough amalgamation
of races and ideas in the various countries of Europe
in which more than one people happened to occupy the
same territory, or come under the jurisdiction of the same
government, when no material difference in religion existed.
In no country has such an amalgamation been more happily
consummated than in our own; if not altogether as to blood,
at least as to feeling, the more important thing of the two;
the physical differences, in occasional instances, appearing in
some localities, on the closest observation of those curious
individuals who make such a subject the object of their
learned researches.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding what has been said, how does it happen
that in Europe, but especially in our own country, there exists,
and has for four hundred years existed, a pretty numerous
body of men distinct in their feelings from the general
population, and some of them in a state of barbarism nearly
as great as when they made their appearance amongst us?
Such a thing would appear to us in no way remarkable in
the stationary condition so long prevalent in Asia; where,
in the case of India, for example, are to be found, inhabiting
the same territory, a heterogeneous population, made up of the
remnants of many nations; where so many languages are
spoken, and religions or superstitions professed, and the people
divided into so many castes, which are separated from
each other on the most trivial, and, to Europeans, ridiculous
and generally incomprehensible points; some eating
together, and others not; some eating mutton, and others
not; some beef and fowls, others vegetables, milk, butter
and eggs, but no flesh or fish; those going to sea not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
associating with those remaining at home; some not following
the occupation of others; and all showing the most determined
antipathy to associate with each other;&mdash;where, from
the numerous facilities so essential toward the perpetuation
of peculiar modes of life, and the want of the powerful elements
of assimilation and amalgamation so prominent in our
division of the human race, a people may continue in a stereotyped
state of mind and habits for an indefinite length of
time. But in a country that is generally looked upon as
the bulwark of the Reformation, and the stronghold of European
civilization, how does it happen that we find a people,
resembling in their nature, though not in the degree, the all
but fabulous tribe that was lately to be found in the dreary
wastes of Newfoundland, flying from the approach, and crossing
the imagination of the fishermen like a spectre? Or like
the wild men of the jungle, in some of the oceanic parts of
Asia, having no homes, roaming during the dry season in the
forests, and sleeping under or on the branches of trees, and
in the rainy season betaking themselves to caves or sheltering
beneath rocks, making their beds of leaves, and living
on what they can precariously find, such as roots and wild
honey; yet, under the influence of the missionary, many of
them now raising crops, building dwellings, erecting schoolhouses,
keeping the Sabbath, and praising God? But some
of the Gipsies with us may be said to do few of these things.
They live among us, yet are not of us; they come in daily
contact with us, yet keep such distance from the community
as a wild fowl, that occasionally finds its way into the farm-yard,
does in shrinking from the close scrutiny of the husbandman.
They cling like bats to ruined houses, caves, and
old lime-kilns; and pitch their tents in dry water-courses,
quarry-holes, or other sequestered places, by the way-side,
or on the open moor, and even on dung-heaps for the warmth
to be derived from them during the winter season, and live
under the bare boughs of the forest during the summer;&mdash;yet
amid all this apparent misery, through fair means or foul,
they fare well, and lead what some call a happy life; while
everything connected with them is most solicitously wrapt
up in inscrutable mystery. These Gipsies exhibit to the
European mind the most inexplicable moral problem on record;
in so far as such phenomena are naturally expected to
be found among a people whom the rays of civilization have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
never reached; while, in the case of the Gipsies, the first
principles of nature would seem to be set at defiance.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;And thus &#8217;tis ever; what&#8217;s within our ken,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Owl-like, we blink at, and direct our search<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fartherest Inde, in quest of novelties;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst here at home, upon our very thresholds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ten thousand objects hurtle into view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of interest wonderful.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But to give a fair description of the tented Gipsy life, I
cannot employ more appropriate language than that of
Doctor Bright, when, in reference to the English Gipsies, he
says: &#8220;I am confident that we are apt to appreciate much
too lightly the actual happiness enjoyed by this class of
people, who, beneath their ragged tents, in the pure air of
the heath, may well excite the envy of many of the poor,
though better provided with domestic accommodation, in the
unwholesome haunts of the town. At the approach of night,
they draw around their humble but often abundant board,
and then retiring to their tent, leave a faithful dog to guard
its entrance. With the first rays of morning, they again
meet the day, pursue their various occupations, or, rolling
up their tents and packing all their property on an ass, set
forward to seek the delights of some fresh heath, or the
protection of some shaded copse. I leave it to those who
have visited the habitations of the poor, to draw a comparison
between the activity, the free condition, and the pure
air enjoyed by the Gipsy, and the idleness, the debauchery,
and the filth in which the majority of the poorer classes are
enveloped.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;No sooner does a stranger approach their fire
on the heath, than a certain reserve spreads itself through
the little family. The women talk to him in mystic language;
they endeavour to amuse him with secrets of futurity; they
suspect him to be a spy upon their actions; and he generally
departs as little acquainted with their true character as he
came. Let this, however, wear away; let him gain their
confidence, and he will find them conversable, amusing, sensible
and shrewd; civil, but without servility; proud of their
independence; and able to assign reasons for preferring
their present condition to any other in civilized society.
He will find them strongly attached to each other, and free
from many cares which too often render the married life a
source of discontent.&#8221;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>In what direction may we look for the causes of such an
anomaly in the history of our common civilization? This
question, however, will be discussed by and by: in the
meantime let us consider the fact itself.</p>

<p>In the early part of the fifteenth century there first appeared
in Europe large hordes of a people of singular complexion
and hair, and mode of life&mdash;apparently an Asiatic
race&mdash;which, in spite of the sanguinary efforts of the governments
of the countries through which they passed, continued
to spread over the continent, and have existed in
large numbers to this day; many of them in the same
condition, and following the same modes of life, now as
then; and preserving their language, if not in its
original purity, yet without its having lost its character.
This circumstance has given rise in recent times to several
researches, with no certain result, as to the country which
they left on entering Europe, and still less as to the place
or the circumstances of their origin. The latter is not to
be wondered at, when it is considered that, in the instances
of even the most polished nations of antiquity, nothing is
to be found as to their origin beyond what is contained in
the myths and fables of their earliest poets and historians.
But considering the traces that have been left of the origin
and early history of the people and kingdoms of Europe,
subsequent to the fall of the Roman Empire, amid the barbarism
and confusion attending their establishment, and, in
many respects, the darkness immediately and for a long time
following it, we would naturally think that, for an event
happening so recently as the fifteenth century, some reliable
traces would have been discovered and bequeathed to us on
a subject that has baffled the antiquarians of modern times.</p>

<p>If, however, there is any doubt as to the country which
they left on entering Europe, and their place of origin, there
remains for us to consider the people generally, and in an
especial manner those who have located themselves in Scotland;
and give an account of their subsequent history in its
various aspects, and their present condition. But before
doing that, it would be well to take a general but cursory
view of the political as well as social condition of Europe
at the time they made their appearance in it, so as, in some
measure, to account for the circumstance of no trace being
left of their previous history; form an estimate of the relative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
position in which they have stood to its general population
since; and attempt to realize the feeling with which
they have always been regarded by our own people, so as
to account for that singular degree of dread and awe which
have always been associated with the mention of their
name; the foundation of which has been laid in infancy.</p>

<p>That which most forcibly strikes the mind of the student,
in reading the history of the age in which the Gipsies
entered Europe, is the political turmoil in which nearly the
whole of the continent seems to have been embroiled for
the greater part of a century. The desperate wars waged
by England against what has been termed her natural
enemy, for the recovery and retention of her ancient continental
possessions, and the struggle of the other for her bare
existence; the long and bloody civil wars of England, and
the distracted state of France, torn with dissensions within,
and menaced at various points from without; the long and
fanatical struggle of religion and race, between the Spaniards
and their invaders, for the possession of the peninsula;
the brave stand made by the Swiss for that independence so
much theirs by nature; the religious wars of the Hussites,
and the commotions throughout central Europe; the perpetual
internal feuds of the corrupt and turbulent southern
republics; the approaching dissolution of the dissolute
Byzantine empire; the appalling progress of that terrible
power that had emerged from the wilds of Asia, subdued
the empire, and threatened Europe from its vulnerable
point; all these seem to have been enough to have engrossed
the mental energies of the various countries of Europe, and
prevented any notice being taken of the appearance of the
race in question.</p>

<p>But over and above these convulsions, sufficient as they
were to exclusively engage the attention of the small amount
of cultivated intellect then in the world, there was one
that was calculated even to paralyze the clergy, to whom,
in that age, fell the business of recording passing events,
and which seems to have prevented their even taking notice
of important matters in the history of that time. I mean
the schism that for so long rent the church into fragments,
the greatest schism, indeed, that the world ever saw, when,
for so many years, two and even three Popes reigned at
once, each anathematizing and excommunicating the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
for a schism which, after an infinity of intrigues, was ultimately
so happily patched up to the comfort of the church.
On the death of Urban V, Gregory XI became Pope, but
soon after died, and was succeeded by Urban VI; but the
Cardinals, who were in the French interest, after treating
him as Pope for a short time, annulled the whole proceedings,
on the plea of having been constrained in the election by
the turbulence of the Roman populace, but really on account
of the extraordinary harshness with which he began his
reign, and chose one of themselves in his stead, under the
name of Clement VII. The former remained at Rome, and
was supported by Italy, the Empire, England and the North;
while Clement proceeded to Avignon, and was acknowledged
by France, Spain, Scotland, and Sicily. Urban was
respectively succeeded by Boniface IX, Innocent VI, and
Gregory XII; and Clement, at his death, in 1394, by
Benedict XIII, the most implacable spirit in prolonging the
schism, from whose authority France for a time withdrew,
without acknowledging any other head, but afterwards
returned, at the same time urging his resignation of the
chair. At last the Cardinals, disgusted with the unprincipled
dissimulation of both, and at their wits&#8217; end in
devising a way to stay the scandal, and build up the
influence of the whole church, then so rapidly sinking in the
estimation of the world, amidst such unheard of calamities,
deserted both, and summoned a council, which met at Pisa,
and in which both were deposed, and another, in the person
of Alexander V, elected to fill the chair. But in place of
proving a remedy, the step rendered the schism still more
furious. After that, John XXIII, successor to Alexander V,
was reluctantly prevailed on to call a council, which accordingly
met at Constance, in 1414, but in which he himself
was deposed. Martin V being chosen, was succeeded by
Eugenius IV. But the Fathers of Basle elected Felix V,
thus renewing the schism, and dividing the church for
some years, from France and the Empire observing a neutrality,
while England adhered to Eugenius, Aragon and
the smaller states to Felix; but the partisans of Felix
gradually losing their influence, Nicholas V, the successor
of Eugenius, after much cajolery, prevailed on him to resign
his claim, and thus restored peace to the world.</p>

<p>At that time the kinds of learning taught were, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
greater part of Europe, confined to few, being almost entirely
monopolised by the clergy and a few laymen; by the former
for the dogmatism of the schools and the study of the canon
law, and by the latter for civil jurisprudence and medicine.
Even the sons of nobles were generally wholly illiterate,
one of them, only, being educated, to act as the clerk of the
family. We are even told of a noble, when a conspiracy
was detected, with the name of his son attached to it, saying,
&#8220;Thank God, none of my children were ever taught to
write.&#8221; The great mass of the people, and especially those
of the lower classes, were as ignorant of direct educational
training as a tribe of semi-barbarians at the present day.
Many of the nobility, although as scantily educated as the
lowest of our own people, and having as much difficulty in
inditing an epistle as some of these would now have, would
still admirably maintain their position in such a state of society,
by the influence which their high birth and breeding,
elevated bearing, superiority of character, and possession
of domain, gave them; and by the traditionary feudal awe
that had sunk so deeply into the feelings of their comparatively,
and often absolutely, abject dependents and followers,
extending itself, when unaccompanied by overt acts of oppression,
to the inhabitants of the smaller towns, where so
many restraints surrounded their personal independence,
from their precarious modes of living, owing to all so much
depending on each other for a subsistence, and the endless
jealousies prevailing among them.</p>

<p>At the same time all classes, although frequently possessing
a sufficiency, if not an abundance, of the rough necessaries
of life, enjoyed nothing of the comfort and elegancies
of subsequent times. The house of many a noble presented
such a plainness in furnishing as a person, in very moderate
circumstances, would now be almost ashamed to possess.
The circumstances of the middle classes were much more
lowly; plain boards and wooden trenchers, few beds but
many <i>shake-downs</i>, rough stools and no chairs, with wonderfully
few apartments relative to the size of the family,
and much sleeping on straw-heaps in the <i>cock-loft</i>, marked
the style of living of a class now deemed very respectable.
The huts of the poorest class were as often composed of
&#8220;sticks and dirt&#8221; as any other material, with <i>plenishing</i> to
correspond. There was a marked exception to this state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of comparative barbarism to be found, however, in some of
the cities of Italy, and other parts of the Mediterranean,
the seats of the flourishing republics of the middle ages;
arising not only from the affluence which follows in the
wake of extended commerce and manufactures, but also
from the feelings with which the wreck of a highly polished
antiquity inspired a people in whom the seeds of the former
civilization had not died out; heightened, as it must have
been, by the influence of the once celebrated, but then decaying,
splendour which the court of the long line of eastern
emperors shed over the countries lying contiguous to it.
The inhabitants of the cities of the north, on the other
hand, were marked by a degree of substantial wealth and
comfort, sense and ease, civility and liberality, which were
apt to distinguish a people situated as they were, without
the traditions and objects, meeting the eye at every step in
the south, of the greatest degree of culture in the polite
arts of life unto which a people can attain. But, with the
exception of the inhabitants of these cities, and some of
those in a few of the cities of western Europe, the clergy
and some of the laity, the people, as such, were sunk in deep
ignorance and superstition, living in a state of which, in our
favoured times, we can form no adequate conception. Then,
life and property were held in little respect, and law trampled
upon, even if it existed under more than the shadow of
its present form; and no roads existed but such as were for
the greater part of the year impassable, and lay through
forests, swamps and other uncultivated wastes, the resorts of
numerous banditti. Then, almost no intercourse existed between
the people of one part of a country and another,
when all were exceedingly sanguinary and rude.</p>

<p>What wonder, then, that, under such circumstances, the
race in question should have stolen into Europe unobserved,
without leaving a trace of the circumstances connected with
the movement? The way by which they are supposed to
have entered Western Europe was by Transylvania, a supposition
which, if not true, is at least most likely. Although,
when first publicly taken notice of in Europe, they were found
to move about in large bands, it is unlikely that they would
do that while entering, but only after having experienced
the degree of toleration and hospitality which the representation
of their condition called forth; at least if we judge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
from the cunning which they have displayed in moving about
after their true character became known. Asia having been
so long their home, where from time immemorial they are
supposed to have wandered, they would have no misgiving,
from their knowledge of its inhabitants, in passing through
any part of it. But in contemplating an entry into Europe
they must have paused, as one, without any experience of his
own or of others, would in entering on the discovery of an
unknown continent, and anxiously examined the merchants
and travellers visiting Europe, on the various particulars of
the country most essential to their prospects, and especially
as to the characteristics of the people. There seems no reason
for thinking that they were expelled from Asia against
their will; and as little for supposing that they fled rather
than submit to a particular creed, if we judge from the
great readiness with which, in form, they have submitted to
such in Europe, when it would serve their purpose. The
only conclusion, in regard to their motive or migration, to
which we can come, is, that having, in the course of time,
gradually found their way to the confines of Western Asia,
and most likely into parts of Northern Africa, and there
heard of the growing riches of modern Europe, they, with
the restlessness and unsettledness of their race, longed to
reach the Eldorado of their hopes&mdash;a country teeming with
what they were in quest of, where they would meet with no
rivals of their own race to cross their path. The step must
have been long and earnestly debated, possibly for generations,
ere it was taken; spies after spies may have surveyed
and reported on the country, and the movement been made
the subject of many deliberations, till at last the influence,
address, or resolution of some chief may have precipitated
them upon it, possibly at a time when some accidental or unavoidable
cause urged them to it. Nor would it be long
ere their example was followed by others of the tribe; some
from motives of friendship; others from jealousy at the idea
of all the imagined advantages being reaped by those going
before them; and others from the desire of revenging unsettled
injuries, and jealousy combined. After the die had
been cast, their first step would be to choose leaders to proceed
before the horde, spy out the richness of the land, and
organize stations for those to follow; and then continue the
migration till all the horde had passed over. Considering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
that the representative part of the Gipsies have retained
their peculiarities almost uncontaminated, it is in the highest
degree probable, it may even be assumed as certain, that this
was the manner in which they entered Europe: at first stragglers,
with systematic relays of stations and couriers, followed
up by such small, yet numerous and closely following,
companies, as almost to escape the notice of the authorities
of the countries through which they passed; a mode of travelling
which they still pursue in Great Britain. But when
any special obstacle was to be encountered in their journey&mdash;such,
for example, as the hostility of the inhabitants of any
particular place&mdash;they would concentrate their strength, so
as to force their way through. Their next step would be to
arrange among themselves the district of country each tribe
was to occupy. After their arrival, they seem to have appeared
publicly in large bands, growing emboldened by the generous
reception which they met with for some time after their
appearance; and they seem to have had the sagacity to
know, that if they secured the favour of the great, that of
the small would necessarily follow.</p>

<p>But if the first appearance of the Gipsies in Europe had a
different complexion from what I have conjectured, there are
other causes to which may be attributed the fact of its not
being known. Among these is to be found the distracted
state of the Eastern Empire in its struggles with the Turks,
which led to the capture of its capital, and the subversion
of the Greek rule in the East. The literary and other men
of note, scattered over the provinces, likely to chronicle such
an event as the appearance of the Gipsies, must necessarily
have betaken themselves to the capital, as each district submitted
to the conquerors, and so lost the opportunity of witnessing
the migration, under such circumstances as would
have made it observable, assuming that the Gipsies travelled
in large companies, which, under all the circumstances of the
case, was not, on all occasions, likely. The surrounding
countries having been the theatre of so many changes in
the history of the human family, and the inhabitants having
undergone so many changes of masters, leading to so many
distinct races, from the intellectual and cultivated Greek to
the barbarous Arab and dusky Moor, of so various hues and
habits, many of whom would be found in such a city as Constantinople,
what peculiarity was there about the Gipsies to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
attract the notice of the haughty Greek, characterized as he
was by all the feelings of disdain which his ancestors displayed
in not even naming the Jews and early Christians?
Then, if we consider the peculiar turn which the new-born
literary pursuits of learned men assumed during that age&mdash;how
it was exclusively confined to the restoration of the
classics, and followed in Europe by the influx of the Greeks
during the troubles of their country, we will find another
reason for the manner of the first appearance of the Gipsies
not being known. Nor is it to be expected that any light
would be thrown on the subject by the memoirs of any of
our own countrymen, visiting the East at a time when so little
intercourse existed between the West and that part of
the world; nothing perhaps beyond a commercial or maritime
adventurer, under the flag of another nation, or one
whose whole acquirements consisted in laying lance in rest
and mounting the breach in an assault; it being a rare thing
even to see an English ship in the Mediterranean during the
whole of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>That the Gipsies were a tribe of Hindoo <i>Sudras</i>, driven,
by the cruelty of Timour, to leave Hindostan, is not for a
moment to be entertained; for why should that conqueror
have specially troubled himself with the <i>lowest</i> class of Hindoos?
or why should they, in particular, have left Hindostan?
It would have been the <i>ruling</i>, or at least the <i>higher</i>,
classes of Hindoo society against which Timour would have
exercised any acts of cruelty; the <i>lowest</i> would be pretty
much beneath his notice. Not only do we not read of such
a people as the Hindoos ever having left their country on
any such account&mdash;for it is contrary to their genius and feelings
of caste to do so&mdash;but the opinion that the Gipsies left
India on Timour&#8217;s account rests on no evidence whatever,
beyond the simple circumstance that they were first taken
notice of in Europe <i>about</i> the time of his overrunning India.
Mr. Borrow very justly remarks: &#8220;It appears singular that
if they left their native land to escape from Timour, they
should never have mentioned, in the western world, the name
of that scourge of the human race, nor detailed the history
of their flight and sufferings, which assuredly would have
procured them sympathy; the ravages of Timour being already
but too well known in Europe.&#8221; Still, Mr. Borrow
does not venture to give reasons for the trustworthiness or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
untrustworthiness of a passage in Arabschah&#8217;s life of
Timour, in which it is said that Gipsies were found in
Samarcand at a time before that conqueror had even directed
his thoughts to the invasion of India. The description
given of these Zingari or Gipsies of Samarcand is as applicable
to the Gipsies as possibly can be; for in it it is
said, &#8220;Some were wrestlers, others gladiators, others pugilists.
These people were much at variance, so that hostilities
and battling were continually arising amongst them.
Each band had its chief and subordinate officers.&#8221; How
applicable this description is to the Scottish Gipsies, down
to so late a period as the end of last century!</p>

<p>If there is little reason for thinking that the Gipsies left
India owing to the cruelties of Timour, there is less for
supposing, as Mr. Borrow supposes, that their being called
Egyptians originated, not with themselves, but with others;
for he says that the tale of their being Egyptians &#8220;probably
originated amongst the priests and learned men of the east
of Europe, who, startled by the sudden apparition of bands
of people foreign in appearance and language, skilled in
divination and the occult arts, endeavoured to find in Scripture
a clue to such a phenomenon; the result of which was
that the Romas (Gipsies) of Hindostan were suddenly transformed
into Egyptian penitents, a title which they have ever
since borne in various parts of Europe.&#8221; Why should the
priests and learned men of the east of Europe go to the
Bible to find the origin of such a people as the Gipsies?
What did priests and learned men know of the Bible at the
beginning of the fifteenth century? Did every priest, at
that time, know there even was such a book as the Bible in
existence? The priests and learned men of the east of Europe
were more likely to turn to the eastern nations for the
origin of the Gipsies, than to Egypt, were the mere matter
of the skill of the Gipsies in divination and the occult arts
to lead them to make any enquiry into their history. But
what could have induced the priests and learned men to
take any such particular interest in the Gipsies? When
the Gipsies entered Europe, they would feel under the necessity
of saying who they were. Having committed themselves
to that point, how could they afterwards call themselves by
that name which Mr. Borrow supposes the priests and
learned men to have given them? Or, I should rather say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
how could the priests and learned men think of giving them
a name after they themselves had said who they were? And
did the priests and learned men invent the idea of the Gipsies
being pilgrims, or bestow upon their leaders the titles
of dukes, earls, lords, counts and knights of Little Egypt?
Assuredly not; all these matters must have originated with
the Gipsies themselves. The truth is, Mr. Borrow has evidently
had no opportunities of learning, or, at least, has not
duly appreciated, the real mental acquirements of the early
Gipsies, an idea of which will be found in the history of
the race on their first general arrival in Scotland, about a
hundred years after they were first taken notice of in Europe,
during which time they are not supposed to have
made any great progress in mental condition. I may venture
to say that the prophecy of Ezekiel,<a name="FNanchor8" id="FNanchor8"></a><a href="#Footnote8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> in regard to the
scattering of the Egyptians, does not apply to the Gipsies,
for this reason, that such of these Egyptians as were <i>carried
away captive</i> would become lost among other nations, while
the &#8220;mixed multitude&#8221; which left Egypt with the Jews, travelled
East, <i>their own masters</i>, and became the origin of the
Gipsy nation throughout the world. If we could but find
traces of an Egyptian origin among the Gipsies of Asia, say
Central and Western Asia, the question would be beyond
dispute. But that might be a matter of some trouble. I
am inclined to believe that the people in India corresponding
to the Gipsies in Europe, will be found among those tented
tribes who perform certain services to the British armies;
at all events there is such a tribe in India, who are called
Gipsies by the Europeans who come in contact with them.
A short time ago, one of these people, who followed the occupation
of a camel driver in India, found his way to England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and &#8220;pulled up&#8221; with some English Gipsies, whom he recognized
as his own people; at least he found that they had the
ways and ceremonies of them. But it would be unreasonable
to suppose that such a tribe in India did not follow various
occupations. Bishop Heber, on several occasions, speaks of
certain tents of people whom he met in India, as Gipsies.
But I can conceive nothing more difficult than an attempt to
elucidate the history of any of the infinity of sects, castes, or
tribes to be met with in India.<a name="FNanchor9" id="FNanchor9"></a><a href="#Footnote9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> What evidently leads Mr.
Borrow and others astray, in the matter of the origin of the
Gipsies, is, that they conclude that, because the language
spoken by the Gipsies is apparently, or for the most part,
Hindostanee, therefore the people speaking it originated in
Hindostan; as just a conclusion as it would be to maintain
that the Negroes in Liberia originated in England because
they speak the English language!</p>

<p>The leaders of the Gipsies, on the arrival of the body in
Europe, and for a long time afterwards, seem to have been
a superior class to those known as Gipsies to-day; although,
if the more intelligent of the race were observable to the
general eye, they would, in many respects, compare most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
favourably with many of our middle classes. If the leaders
of the Gipsies, at that time, fell behind some of even the nobility,
in the pittance of the education of letters which the
latter possessed, they made up for it in that practical sagacity,
the acquisition of which is almost unavoidable in the school in
which, from infancy, they had been educated&mdash;that of providing
for the shifts and exigencies of which their lives, as a
whole, consisted; besides showing that superior aptitude for
many of the things of every-day life, so inseparable from the
success to which a special pursuit will lead. A Gipsy leader
stood, then, somewhat in the position towards a gentleman
that a swell does to-day; with this difference, that he was
not apt to commit himself by the display of that ignorance
which unmasks the swell; an ignorance which the gentleman,
in spite of his little learning, no less shared in. If the latter
happened to be well educated, the Gipsy could still pass
muster, from being as well, or rather as ill, informed as many
with whom the gentleman associated. The Gipsy being
alert, capable of playing many characters, often a good musician,
an excellent player at games of hazard, famous at tale
and repartee, clever at sleight of hand tricks, ready with his
weapon, at least in the boast of it, apt at field and athletic
sports, suspicious of everything and everybody around him,
the whole energies of his mind given to, and his life spent in,
circumventing and plundering those around him, while, in
appearance, &#8220;living in peaceable and catholic manner,&#8221; and
&#8220;doing a lawful business,&#8221; and having that thorough knowledge
of men acquired by mixing with all classes, in every
part of the country&mdash;he became even more than a match for
the other, whose life was spent in occasional forays, field
sports and revellings, with so little to engage his intellectual
nature, from his limited education, the non-existence of books,
and the forms of government and social institutions, with
those beautifully complicated bearings and interests towards
general society which the present age displays. At such a
time, conversation must have been confined to the ordinary
affairs of common life, the journal of much of which, beyond
one&#8217;s own immediate neighbourhood, would be found in the
conversation of the accomplished Gipsy, who had the tact of
ingratiating himself, in a manner peculiar to himself, with all
kinds of society, even sometimes the very best. And it is
remarkable that, when the Gipsies were persecuted, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
seldom, if ever, at the instance of private individuals, but
almost always by those acting under authority. If they
were persecuted by a private individual, they would naturally
leave for another district, and place themselves, for a
time, in the nominal position of a clansman to such barons as
would be always ready to receive them. The people at large
generally courted their friendship, for the amusement which
they afforded them, and the various services which they rendered
them, the most important of which was the safety of
property which followed from such an acquaintance. That
being the case even with people of influence, it may be judged
what position the Gipsies occupied towards the various
classes downwards; the lowest of which they have always
despised, and delighted to tyrannize over. In coming among
them, the Gipsies, from the first, exhibited ways of life and
habits so dissimilar to those of the natives, and such tricks
of legerdemain so peculiar to Eastern nations, and such
claims of seeing into the future, as to cause many to believe
them in league with the evil one; a conclusion very easily
arrived at, in the darkness in which all were wrapped. Although
the rabble of the Gipsies is said to have presented,
in point of accoutrements, a most lamentable appearance,
that could much more have been said of the same class of
the natives, then, and long after, if we judge of a Highland
&#8220;tail,&#8221; of a little more than a century ago, as described by
the author of Waverly; or even of the most unwashed of
what has been termed the &#8220;unwashed multitude&#8221; of to-day.
In point of adaptability to their respective modes of life, the
poorest of the Gipsies far excelled the others. To carry out
the character of pilgrims, the bulk of the Gipsies would go
very poorly dressed; it would only be the chiefs who would
be well accoutred.</p>

<p>But the Gipsies that appear to the general eye have fallen
much from what they were. The superior class of Scottish
Gipsies, possessing the talents and policy necessary to accommodate
themselves to the change of circumstances around
them, have adopted the modes of ordinary life to such an
extent, and so far given up their wandering habits, as to
baffle any chance of discovery by any one unacquainted with
their history, and who will not, like a bloodhound, follow
them into the retreats in which they and their descendants
are now to be found. Such Gipsies are still a restless race,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and nourish that inveterate attachment to their blood and
language which is peculiar to all of them. When we consider
the change that has come over the face of society during
the last hundred years, or even during a much shorter
time, we will find many causes that have contributed to that
which has come over the Gipsy character in its more atrocious
aspect. All classes of our own people, from the highest
to the lowest, have experienced the change; and nowhere
to a greater extent than in the Highlands, where, in little
more than a hundred years, a greater reformation has been
effected, than took almost any other part of the world perhaps
three centuries to accomplish; and where the people,
as a body, have emerged, from a state of sanguinary barbarism,
into the most lawful and the most moral and religious
subjects of the British Empire. The Gipsies have likewise
felt the change. Even the wildest of them have had the
more outrageous features of their character subdued; but it
is sometimes as an animal of prey, sans teeth, sans claws, sans
everything. Officials, in the zeal of their callings, often
greatly distress those that go about&mdash;compelling them, in
their wanderings, to &#8220;move on;&#8221; and look after them so
closely, that when they become obnoxious to the inhabitants,
the offence has hardly occurred, ere, to use an expression,
they are snapped up before they have had time to squeak.
Amid such a state of things, it is difficult for Gipsies to
flourish in their glory; still, such of them as go about in the
olden form are deemed very annoying.</p>

<p>The dread which has always been entertained toward the
Gipsies has been carefully fostered by them, and has become
the principal means contributing to their toleration. They
have always been combined in a brotherhood of sentiment
and interest, even when deadly feuds existed among them;
an injury toward one being generally taken up by others;
and have presented that union of sympathy, and lawless
violence toward the community, which show what a few
audacious and desperate men, under such circumstances, will
sometimes do in a well regulated society. Sir Walter Scott,
relative to the original of one of his heroines, says: &#8220;She
was wont to say that she could bring, from the remotest
parts of the island friends, to revenge her quarrel, while she
sat motionless in her cottage; and frequently boasted that
there was a time when she was of still more considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
importance, when there were at her wedding fifty saddled
asses, and unsaddled asses without number.&#8221; But of their
various crimes, none have had such terrors for the grown-up
person as those of fire-raising and child-stealing. The Gipsy
could easily steal into a well guarded but scattered premises,
by night, and, in an instant, spread devastation around him,
and irretrievable ruin to the rural inhabitant. But that
which has, perhaps, contributed most to the feeling in question,
has been their habit of child-stealing, the terrors of
which have grown up with the people from infancy. This
trait in the Gipsy character has certainly not been so common,
in latter times, as some others; still, it has taken place.
As an instance, it may be mentioned that Adam Smith, the
author of the great work called &#8220;An Enquiry into the
Causes of the Wealth of Nations,&#8221; was actually carried off
by the Gipsies, when a child, and was some hours in their
possession before recovery. It is curious to think what
might have been the political state of so many nations, and
of Great Britain in particular, at the present time, if the
father of political economy and free-trade, as he is generally
called, had had to pass his life in a Gipsy encampment, and,
like a white transferred to an Indian wigwam, under similar
circumstances, acquired all their habits, and become more
incorrigibly attached to them than the people themselves;
tinkering kettles, pots, pans and old metal, in place of separating
the ore of a beautiful science from the d&eacute;bris which
had been for generations accumulating around it, and working
it up into one of the noblest monuments of modern times.</p>

<p>When a child will become unruly, the father will often
say, in the most serious manner, &#8220;Mother, that canna be
our bairn&mdash;the Tinklers must have taken ours, and left
theirs&mdash;are you sure that this is ours? Gie him back to
the Gipsies again, and get our ain.&#8221; The other children
will look as bewildered, while the subject of remark will
instantly stop crying, and look around for sympathy; but
meeting nothing but suspicion in the faces of all, will
instinctively flee to its mother, who as instinctively clasps it
to her bosom, quieting its terrors, as a mother only can,
with the lullaby,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>And the result is, that it will remain a &#8220;good bairn&#8221; for a
long time after. This feeling, drawn into the juvenile mind,
as food enters into the growth of the body, acts like the
influence of the stories of ghosts and hobgoblins, often so
inconsiderately told to children, but differs from it in this
respect, that what causes it is true, while its effects are
always more or less permanent. It has had this effect upon
our youth&mdash;in connection with the other habits of the people,
so outlandish when compared with the ways of our own&mdash;that
should they happen to go a little distance from home, on such
expeditions as boys are given to, and fall in with a Gipsy
camp, a strange sensation of fear takes possession of them.
The camp is generally found to be pitched in some little dell
or nook, and so hidden from view as not to be noticed till
the stranger is almost precipitated into its midst ere he is
aware of it. What with the traditionary feeling toward
the Gipsies, and the motley assemblage of wild looking
men, and perhaps still wilder looking women, ragged little
urchins, ferocious looking dogs, prepared for an assault with
an instinct drawn from the character of their masters, and
the droll appearance of so many <i>cuddies</i> (asses,) startled in
their browsing&mdash;animals that generally appear singly, but,
when driven by Gipsies, come in battalions;&mdash;the boys, at
first rivetted to the spot with terror, will slip away as
quietly as possible till a little way off, and then run till
they have either arrived at home, or come within the reach
of a neighbourhood or people likely to protect them,
although, it might be, the Gipsies had not even noticed
them.<a name="FNanchor11" id="FNanchor11"></a><a href="#Footnote11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Curiosity is so strong in our youth, in such cases,
as often to induce them to return to the spot, after being
satisfied that the Gipsies have decamped for another district.
They will then examine the d&eacute;bris of the encampment with
a great degree of minuteness, wreaking their vengeance on
what is left, by turning up with their feet the refuse of
almost everything edible, particularly as regards the bones
and feathers of fowl and game, and, if it happened to be
near the sea, crab, limpet, and whelk shells, and heaps of
tin clippings and horn scrapings. In after life, they will
often think of and visit the scenes of such adventures. At
other times, our youth, when rambling, will often make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
detour of several miles, to avoid falling in with the dreaded
Gipsies. The report of Gipsies being about acts as a salutary
check upon the depredatory habits of the youth of our
country towns on neighbouring crops; for, as the farmers
make up their minds to lose something by the Gipsies, at any
rate, the wholesome dread they inspire, even in grown-up
lads, is such as, by night especially, to scare away the thieves
from those villages, whose plunderings are much greater,
and more unwillingly submitted to, from the closeness of
residence of the offenders; so that the arrival of the Gipsies,
in some places, is welcomed, at certain times of the year,
as the lesser of two evils; and, to that extent, they have
been termed the &#8220;farmers&#8217; friends.&#8221; And if a little encouragement
is given them&mdash;such as the matter of &#8220;dogs&#8217;
payment,&#8221; that is, what they can eat and drink, and a mouthful
of something for the <i>cuddy</i>, for the first day after their
arrival&mdash;the farmer can always enlist an admirable police,
who will guard his property against others, with a degree
of faithfulness that can hardly be surpassed. I heard of a
Scottish farmer, very lately, getting the Gipsies to take up
their quarters every year on the corner of a potato or turnip
field, with the express purpose of using them, as half constables
half scare-crows, against the common rogues of the
neighbourhood. &#8220;Now,&#8221; said he to the principal Gipsy, &#8220;I
put you in charge of this property. If you want anything
for yourselves, come to the barn.&#8221; Whatever might have
been the experience of farmers near by, this farmer never
missed anything while the Gipsies were on his premises.</p>

<p>But a greater degree of awe is inspired by the females
than the males of the Gipsies. In their periodical wanderings,
they will generally, with their fortune-telling, turn the
heads of the country girls in matters of matrimony&mdash;setting
them all agog on husbands; and render them, for the time,
of but little use to their employers. In teaching them the
&#8220;art of love,&#8221; they will professedly so instruct them as to
have as many lovers at once as their hearts can desire. But
if a country girl, with her many admirers, has one to get
quit of, who is &#8220;no&#8217; very weel faured, but a clever fellow,&#8221;
or another, who is &#8220;no&#8217; very bright in the upper story, but
strapping enough to become the dish-clout,&#8221; she will call in
the assistance of the strolling Gipsy; who, after carefully
weighing the circumstances of the case, will sometimes, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
ordinary means have failed, collect, unknown to her, a
bucket full of everything odious about a dwelling, wait at
the back door the return of the rustic Adonis, and, ere he is
aware, dash it full in his face; then fold her arms akimbo,
and quietly remark, &#8220;That will cool your ears, and your
courting too, my man!&#8221; Such Gipsy women are peculiarly
dreaded by the males of our own people, who will much
sooner encounter those of the other sex; for, however much
some of them may be satisfied, in their cooler moments, that
these Gipsy women will not attempt what they will sometimes
threaten, they generally deem them &#8220;unco uncanny,&#8221;
at any time, and will flee when swearing that they will <i>gut</i>
or <i>skin alive</i> all who may have anything to say to them.</p>

<p>To people unacquainted with the peculiarities of the Gipsies,
it may appear that this picture is overdrawn. But Sir
Walter Scott, who is universally allowed to be a true depicter
of Scottish life, in every form, says, in reference to the
original of Meg Merrilies, in Guy Mannering: &#8220;I remember
to have seen one of her grand-daughters; that is, as Dr.
Johnson had a shadowy recollection of Queen Anne&mdash;a stately
lady in black, adorned with diamonds; so my memory is
haunted by a solemn remembrance of a woman, of more than
female height, dressed in a long, red cloak, who commenced
acquaintance by giving me an apple, but whom, nevertheless,
I looked on with as much awe as the future Doctor could
look upon the Queen.&#8221; And he approvingly quotes another
writer, as to her daughter, as follows: &#8220;Every week, she paid
my father a visit for her <i>awmons</i>, when I was a little boy,
and I looked on her with no common degree of awe and
terror.&#8221; The same feeling, somewhat modified, I have heard
expressed by Germans, Spaniards, and Italians. In England,
the people do not like to trouble the Gipsies, owing to
their being so &#8220;spiteful,&#8221; as they express it. The feeling in
question cannot well be realized by people reared in towns,
who have, perhaps, never seen Gipsies, or heard much about
them; but it is different with youths brought up in the country.
When the Gipsies, in their peregrinations, will make
their appearance at a farmer&#8217;s house, especially if it is in the
pastoral districts, and the farmer be a man of information
and reflection, he will often treat them kindly, from the interest
with which their singular history inspires him; and
others, not unkindly, from other motives. The farmer&#8217;s sons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
who are young and hasty, probably but recently returned
from a town, where they have been jeered at for their cowardice
in being afraid to meddle with the Gipsies, will show
a disposition to use them roughly, on the cry arising in the
house, that &#8220;the Tinklers are coming.&#8221; But the old father,
cautious with the teachings of years gone by, will become
alarmed at such symptoms, and, before the Gipsies have
approached the premises, will urge his children to treat them
kindly. &#8220;Be canny now, bairns&mdash;be canny; for any sake
dinna anger them; gie them a&#8217; they want, and something
more.&#8221; With this, a good fat sheep will sometimes be killed,
and the band regaled with <i>kail</i>, and its accompaniments; or,
if they are very <i>nice gabbit</i>, it will be served up to them in a
roasted form. Thereafter, they will retire to the barn, and
start in the morning on something better than an empty
stomach.</p>

<p>And yet it is singular that, if the Gipsies are met in the
streets of a town, or any considerably frequented place, people
will, in passing them, edge off a little to the side, and
look at them with a degree of interest, which, on ordinary
occasions, the Gipsies will but little notice. But if a person
of respectable appearance will scrutinize them in an ominous
way, they will observe it instantly; and, as a swell-mobsman,
on being stared at by a detective, on the mere suspicion of
his being such, generally turns the first cross street, and, in
turning, anxiously looks after his enemy, who, after calculating
the distance, has also turned to watch his movements,
so the Gipsy will become excited, soon turning round to
watch the movements of the object of his dread; a fear that
will be heightened if any of his band has been spoken to.
And such is the masonic secrecy with which they keep their
language, that should they at the time have rested on the
road-side, and the stranger assume the most impressive tone,
and say: &#8220;<i>Sallah, jaw drom</i>&#8220;&mdash;(curse you, take the road),
the effects upon them are at first bewildering, and followed
by a feeling of some dire calamity that is about to befall
them. When any of the poorest kind can be prevailed upon
to express a candid sentiment, and be asked how they really
do get on, they will reply, &#8220;It&#8217;s only day and way we want,
ye ken&mdash;what a farmer body ne&#8217;er can miss; foreby selling a
spoon, and tinkering a kettle now and then.&#8221;</p>

<p>In viewing the effects of civilization upon a barbarous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
race, we are naturally led to confine our reflections to some
of the instances in which the civilized race has carried its
influence abroad to those beyond its pale, to the exclusion
of those instances, from their infrequency of occurrence, in
which the barbarous race, of its own accord or otherwise,
has come within its circle. There are but two instances, in
modern times, in which the latter has happened, and they are
well worthy of our notice. The one is, the existence of the
Gipsies, in the very heart of civilization; the other, that of
the Africans in the various European settlements in the
New World; and between these a short comparison may
be instituted, although at the risk of it being deemed a
digression.</p>

<p>The forcible introduction of barbarous men into the colonies
of civilized nations, in spite of the cruelties which many
of them have undergone, has greatly improved their condition&mdash;their
moral and intellectual nature&mdash;at the expense
of the melancholy fact of it being advanced as a reason of
justification for that sad anomaly in the history of our times.
The African, it is admitted, was forcibly brought under
the influence of the refinement, religion, and morals of
the whites, whether as a domestic under the same roof,
a field labourer, in the immediate vicinity of the master, or
in some other way under his direct control and example.
Not only was he, as it were, forced to become what he is,
but his obedient, light-hearted, and imitative nature, even
under many bodily sufferings, instinctively led him to enter
immediately into the spirit of a new life, presenting to his
barbarous imagination, so destitute of everything above the
grossest of animal wants and propensities, those wonderfully
incessant and complicated employments of a being, appearing
to him as almost a god, when compared with his own savage
and unsophisticated nature. The importations comprised
Negroes of many dialects, which were distributed on arrival
in every direction. A large proportion would live singly
with the poorer classes of the colonists, as domestics; two
or three would be the limited number with many others, and
the remainder would be disposed of, in larger or smaller
numbers, for the various services necessary in civilized life.
Single domestics would be under the necessity of learning the
language of the master; and, having none speaking their
own dialect to commune with, or only occasionally meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
such, momentarily, they would soon forget it. When several
of different dialects lived together, they would naturally
follow the same course, to communicate with each other.
All these circumstances, with the frequent changes of masters
and companions, and the general influence which the whites
exercised so supremely over them, have had the effect of almost
erasing every trace of the language, customs, and superstitions
of Africa, in parts of the United States of America,
in little more than one generation. The same may especially
be said of what pertains to the religious; for a race of men,
in a state of nature, or but slightly civilized, depending for
such instruction on the adjunct of a superior grade, in the
person of a priest, would, on being deprived of such, soon
lose recollection of what had been taught them. Such an
instance as to language, and, I understand, to a great extent
as to religion, is to be found in St. Domingo; French and
Spanish being spoken in the parts of that island which belonged
to these countries respectively. Still, such traces are
to be found in Cuba; but, were importations of Africans into
that island to cease, the same result would, in course of time,
follow. From such causes as those stated, the Negroes in
the United States have, to a very great extent, nay, as far
as their advantages and opportunities have gone, altogether,
acquired the ways of civilized life, and adopted the morals
and religion of the white race; and their history compares
favourably with that of a portion of the Gipsy race, which,
being unique, and apparently incomprehensible, I will institute
a short enquiry into some of the causes of it.</p>

<p>While the language and common origin of the Gipsies hold
them together as a body, their mode of life has taken such a
hold on the innate nature of the representative part of them,
as to render it difficult to wean them from it. Like the
North American Indians, they have been incapable of being
reduced to a state of servitude;<a name="FNanchor12" id="FNanchor12"></a><a href="#Footnote12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and, in their own peculiar
way, have been as much attached to a life of unrestricted
freedom of movement. Being an Oriental people, they have
displayed the uniformity of attachment to habit, that has
characterized the people of that part of the world. Like
the maidens of Syria, wearing to-day the identical kind of
veil with which Rebecca covered herself when she met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Isaac, they have, with few exceptions, adhered to all that
originally distinguished them from those among whom they
are found. In entering Europe, they would meet with few
customs which they would willingly adopt in preference to
their own. Their chiefs, being men of ambition, and fond
of a distinguished position in the tribe, would influence the
body to remain aloof from the people at large; and society
being divided between the nobles and their various grades
of dependents, and the restrained inhabitants of towns, with
what part of the population could the Gipsies have been incorporated?
With the lowest classes only, and become
little better than serfs&mdash;a state to which it was almost impossible
for a Gipsy to submit. His habits rendered him
unfit to till the soil; the close and arbitrary laws of municipalities
would debar him from exercising almost any mechanical
trade, in a way suitable to his disposition; and, no
matter what might have been his natural propensities, he
had almost no alternative left him but to wander, peddle,
tinker, tell fortunes, and &#8220;find things that nobody ever lost.&#8221;
His natural disposition was to rove, and partake of whatever
he took a liking to; nothing coming so acceptably and so
sweetly to him, as when it required an exercise of ingenuity,
and sometimes a degree of danger, in its acquisition, and
caused a corresponding chagrin to him from whom it was
taken, without affording him any trace of the purloiner.
He must also enjoy the sports of the river and lake, the
field, hill and forest, and the pleasure of his meal, cooked
after his own fashion, in some quiet spot, where he would
pitch his tent, and quench his thirst at his favourite
springs. Then followed the persecution of his race; both
by law and society it was declared outcast, although, by a
large part of the latter, it was, from selfish motives, tolerated,
and, in a measure, courted. The Gipsy&#8217;s mode of life; his
predatory habits; his vindictive disposition toward his enemies;
his presumptuous bearing toward the lower classes, who
had purchased his friendship and protection; his astuteness
in doubling upon and escaping his pursuers; his audacity,
under various disguises and pretences, in bearding justice,
and the triumphant manner in which he would generally
escape its toils; his utter destitution of religious opinions,
or sentiments; his being a foreigner of such strongly marked
appearance, under the legal and social ban of proscription;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and the hereditary name which has, in consequence, attached
to his race, have created those broad and deep-drawn lines of
isolation, fear and antipathy, which, in the popular mind,
have separated him from other men. To escape from the
dreadful prejudice that is, in consequence, entertained toward
his race, the Gipsy will, if it be possible, hide the fact of his
being a Gipsy; and more especially when he enters upon
settled life, and mixes with his fellow-men in the world.</p>

<p>In the general history of Europe, we can find nothing to
illustrate that of the Gipsies. But if we take a glance at
the history of the New World, we will find, in a mild and
harmless form, something that bears a slight resemblance to
it. In various parts of the eastern division of North
America are to be found remnants of tribes of Indians,
living in the hearts of the settlements, on reserves of lands
granted to them for their support; a race bearing somewhat
the same resemblance to the European settlers that the
Gipsies, with their dark complexion, and long, coarse, black
hair, seem to have borne to the natives of Europe. Few of
these Indians, although in a manner civilized, and professing
the Christian religion, and possessing houses, schools and
churches, have betaken, or, if they support their numbers,
will ever betake, themselves to the ways of the other inhabitants.
They will engage in many things to make a
living, and a bare living; in that respect very much resembling
some of the Gipsies. They will often leave their
home, and build their wigwams whenever and wherever
they have a mind, and indulge in the pleasures of hunting
and laziness; and often make numerous small wares for
sale, with the proceeds of which, and of the timber growing
on their lots of land, they will manage to pass their lives in
little better than sloth, often accompanied by drunkenness.
If it prove otherwise, it is generally from the Indian, or
rather half or quarter breed, having been wholly or partly
reared with whites, or otherwise brought up under their
immediate influence; or from the ambition of their chiefs to
raise themselves in the estimation of the white race, leading,
from the influence which they possess, to some of the lower
grades of the tribes following their example. It may be
that the &#8220;poor Indian&#8221; has voluntarily exiled himself, in a
fit of melancholy, from the wreck of his patrimony, to make
a miserable shift for himself elsewhere, as he best may. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
this respect the resemblance fails: that the Indian in America
is aboriginal, the Gipsy in Europe foreign, to the soil; but both
are characterized by a nature that renders them almost
impervious to voluntary change. In this they resemble
each other: that they are left to live by themselves, and
transmit to their descendants their respective languages,
and such of their habits as the change in their outward circumstances
will permit. But in this they differ: that these
Indians really do die out, while the Gipsies are very prolific,
and become invigorated by a mixture of the white blood;
under the cover of which they gradually leave the tent, and
become scattered over and through society, enter into the
various pursuits common to the ordinary natives, and become
lost to the observation of the rest of the population.</p>

<p>The peculiar feeling that is entertained for what is popularly
understood to be a Gipsy, differs from that which is
displayed toward the Negro, in that it attaches to his traditional
character and mode of life alone. The general prejudice
against the Negro is, to a certain extent, natural,
and what any one can realize. If the European has a
difficulty in appreciating the feeling which is exhibited by
Americans against the African, in their general intercourse
of daily life, few Americans can realize the feeling which is
entertained toward the tented Gipsy. Should such a Gipsy
be permitted to enter the dwelling of a native, the most he
will let him come in contact with will be the chair he will
give him to sit on, and the dish and spoon out of which he
will feed him, all of which can again be cleaned. His
guest will never weary his patience, owing to the embodiment
of restlessness which characterizes his race; nor will
his feelings ever be tried by his asking him for a bed, for
what the herb commonly called catnip is to the animal somewhat
corresponding to that word, a bundle of straw in an
out-house is to the tented Gipsy.</p>

Egyptians, here foretold, is a subject about which very little is known.
Scott, in commenting on it, says: &#8220;History informs us that Nebuchadnezzar

<p>The bulk of the Egyptians were doubtless restored to their country, as
promised in Ezek. xxix. 13, 14, and it is not impossible that the Gipsies are
the descendants of such as did not return to Egypt. The language which
they now speak proves nothing to the contrary, as, since the time in question,
they have had opportunities to learn and unlearn many languages.</p>

to emigrate thither, in times of trouble or famine, from their native land, and
to establish themselves amongst strangers. This species of emigration is
very common in all the countries of India; but what is most remarkable is,
<i>that in a foreign land, these emigrants preserve, from generation to generation,
their own language and national peculiarities</i>. Many instances might be
pointed out of such foreign families, settled four or five hundred years in the
district they now inhabit, without approximating in the least to the manners,
fashions, or even to the language, of the nation where they have been
for so many generations naturalized. They still preserve the remembrance
of their origin, and keep up the ceremonies and usages of the land where
their ancestors were born, without ever receiving any tincture of the particular
habits of the countries where they live.&#8221;&mdash;Preface xvii.</p>

<p>At page 470, he gives an instance of a wandering tribe in the Mysore and
Telinga country, originally employed in agriculture, who, a hundred and
fifty years previously, took up their vagrant and wandering life, in consequence
of the severe treatment which the governor of the province was
going to inflict upon some of their favourite chiefs. To this kind of life they
have grown so much accustomed, that it would be impossible to reclaim
them to any fixed or sedentary habits; and they have never entertained a
thought of resuming their ancient manners. They sojourn in the open
fields, under small tents of bamboo, and wander from place to place as
humour dictates. They amount to seven or eight thousand individuals,
are divided into tribes, and are under the government of chiefs, and maintain
a great respect for the property of others.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<hr class="c25" />

<p>The new era which the series of splendid works, called
the Waverly Novels, created in literature, produced, among
other effects, that of directing attention to that singular
anomaly in civilization&mdash;the existence of a race of men
scattered over the world, and known, wherever the English
language is spoken, as Gipsies; a class as distinct, in some
respects, from the people among whom they live, as the Jews
at the present day. The first of the series in which their
singular characters, habits, and modes of life were illustrated,
was that of Guy Mannering; proving one of the few happy
instances in which a work of fiction has been found to serve
the end of specially stirring up the feelings of the human
mind, in its various phases, toward a subject with which it
has a common sympathy. The peasant and the farmer at
once felt attracted by it, from the dread of personal danger
which they had always entertained for the race, and the uncertainty
under which they had lived, for the safety of their
property from fire and robbery, and the desire which they
had invariably shown to propitiate them by the payment of
a species of blackmail, under the form of kind treatment,
and a manner of hospitality when occasion called for it.
The work at the same time struck a chord in the religious
and humane sentiments of others, and the result, but a very
tardily manifested one, was the springing up of associations
for their reformation; with comparatively little success,
however, for it was found, as a general thing, that while
some of the race allowed their children, very indifferently,
even precariously, to attend school, yet to cure them of their
naturally wandering and other peculiar dispositions, was
nearly as hopeless as the converting of the American
Indians to some of the ways of civilized life. That general
class was also interested, which consist of the more or less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
educated, moral, or refined, to whom anything exciting
comes with relish. To the historical student, the subject
was fraught with matter for curious investigation, owing to
the race having been ignored, for a length of time, as being
in no respect different from a class to be found in all countries;
and, whatever their origin, as having had their
nationality extinguished in that general process which has
been found to level every distinction of race in our country.
The antiquary and philologist, in their respective pursuits,
found also a sphere which they were unlikely to leave unexplored,
considering that they are often so untiring in their
researches in such matters as sometimes to draw upon themselves
a smile from the rest of mankind: and while the
latter was thinking that he had exhausted the languages of
his native land, and was contemplating others elsewhere, he
struck accidentally upon a mine under his feet, and at once
turned up a specimen of virgin ore; coming all the more
acceptably to him, from those in possession of it keeping it
as secret as if their existence depended on its being concealed
from others around them. All, indeed, but especially
those brought up in rural places, knew from childhood more
or less of the Gipsies, and dreaded them by day or night,
in frequented or in lonely places, knowing well that, if
insulted, they would threaten vengeance, if they could not
execute it then; which they in no way doubted, with the
terror of doomed men.</p>

<p>Among others, I felt interested in the subject, from having
been brought up in the pastoral district of Tweed-dale, the
resort of many Gipsies, who were treated with great favour
by the inhabitants, for many reasons, the most important
of which were the desire of securing their good-will, for
their own benefit, and the use which they were to them in
selling them articles in request, and the various mechanical
turns which they possessed; and often from the natural
generosity of people so circumstanced. My curiosity was
excited, and having various sources of information at command,
I proceeded to write a few short articles for Blackwood&#8217;s
Magazine, which were well received, as the following
letters from Mr. William Blackwood will show:</p>

<p>&#8220;I now send a proof of No. 2 Gipsy article. I hope you
are pleased, and will return it with your corrections on
Monday or Tuesday. We shall be glad to hear you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
going on with the continuation, for I assure you your former
article has been as popular as anything almost we ever had
in the magazine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again,</p>

<p>&#8220;Your magazine was sent this morning by the coach, but
I had not time to write you last night. Mr. Walter Scott
is quite delighted with the Gipsies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again,</p>

<p>&#8220;I am this moment favoured with your interesting packet.
Your Gipsies, from the slight glance I have given them,
seem to be as amusing as ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>And again,</p>

<p>&#8220;It was not in my power to get your number sent off. It
is a very interesting one. You will be much pleased with
Mr. Scott&#8217;s little article on Buckhaven, in which he pays
you some very just compliments.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor13" id="FNanchor13"></a><a href="#Footnote13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>At the same time I was much encouraged, by the author
of Guy Mannering, to prosecute my enquiries, by receiving
several communications from him, and conversing with him
at Abbotsford, on the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>I received a letter from Sir Walter, in which he says:</p>

<p>&#8220;This letter has been by me many weeks, waiting for a
frank, and besides, our mutual friend, Mr. Laidlaw, under
whose charge my agricultural operations are now proceeding
in great style, gave me some hope of seeing you in this
part of the country. I should like much to have asked you
some questions about the Gipsies, and particularly that great
mystery&mdash;their language. I cannot determine, in my own
mind, whether it is likely to prove really a corrupt eastern
dialect, or whether it has degenerated into mere jargon.&#8221;</p>

<p>About the same time I received the following letter from
Mr. William Laidlaw, the particular friend of Sir Walter
Scott, and manager of his estate at Abbotsford, as mentioned
in the foregoing letter; the author of &#8220;Lucy&#8217;s Flittin,&#8221;
and a contributor to Blackwood:</p>

<p>&#8220;I was very seriously disappointed at not seeing you
when you were in this (part of the) country, and so was no
less a person than the mighty minstrel himself. He charged
me to let him know whenever you arrived, for he was very
anxious to see you. What would it be to you to take the
coach, and three days before you, and again see your father
and mother, come here on an evening, and call on Mr. Scott
next day? We would then get you full information upon
the science of defence in all its departments. Quarterstaff
is now little practised; but it was a sort of legerdemain
way of fighting that I never had <i>muckle broo of</i>, although I
know somewhat of the method. It was a most unfortunate
and stupid trick of the man to blow you up with your kittle
acquaintances. I hope they will forgive and forget. I am
very much interested about the language (Gipsy). Mr.
Scott has repeatedly said, that whatever you hear or see, you
should <i>never let on to naebody</i>, no doubt excepting himself.
Be sure and come well provided with specimens of the
vocables, as he says he might perhaps have it in his power
to assist you in your enquiries.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shortly after this, Sir Walter wrote me as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;The inclosed letter has long been written. I only now
send it to show that I have not been ungrateful, though late
in expressing my thanks. The progress you have been able
to make in the Gipsy language is most extremely interesting.
My acquaintance with most European languages, and with
slang words and expressions, enables me to say positively,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
that the Gipsy words you have collected have no reference
to either, with the exception of three or four.<a name="FNanchor14" id="FNanchor14"></a><a href="#Footnote14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> I have
little doubt, from the sound and appearance, that they are
Oriental, probably Hindostanee. When I go to Edinburgh,
I shall endeavour to find a copy of Grellmann, to compare
the language of the German Gipsies with that of the Scottish
tribes. As you have already done so much, I pray you
to proceed in your enquiries, but by no means to make anything
public, as it might spread a premature alarm, and
obstruct your future enquiries. It would be important
to get the same words from different individuals; and in
order to verify the collection, I would recommend you to
set down the names of the persons by whom they were communicated.
It would be important to know whether they
have a real language, with the usual parts of speech, or
whether they have a collection of nouns, combined by our own
language. I suspect the former to be the case, from the
specimens I have had. I should like much to see the article
you proposed for the magazine. I am not squeamish about
delicacies, where knowledge is to be sifted out and acquired.
I like Ebony&#8217;s<a name="FNanchor15" id="FNanchor15"></a><a href="#Footnote15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> idea of a history of the Gipsies very much,
and I wish you would undertake it. I gave all my scraps
to the magazine at its commencement, but I think myself
entitled to say that you are welcome to the use of them,
should you choose to incorporate them into such a work.
Do not be in too great a hurry, but get as many materials
as you can.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor16" id="FNanchor16"></a><a href="#Footnote16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>And again as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;An authentic list of Gipsy words, as used in Scotland,
especially if in such numbers as may afford any reasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
or probable conjecture as to the structure of the language,
is a desideratum in Scottish literature which would be very
acceptable to the philologist, as well as an addition to general
history. I am not aware that any such exists, though
there is a German publication on the subject, which it would
be very necessary to consult.<a name="FNanchor17" id="FNanchor17"></a><a href="#Footnote17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> That the language exists, I
have no doubt, though I should rather think the number to
which it is known is somewhat exaggerated. I need not
point out to you the difference between the <i>cant</i> language,
or <i>slang</i>, used by thieves or flash men in general, and the
peculiar dialect said to be spoken by the Gipsies.<a name="FNanchor18" id="FNanchor18"></a><a href="#Footnote18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The
difference ought to be very carefully noticed, to ascertain
what sort of language they exactly talk; whether it is an
original tongue, having its own mode of construction, or a
speech made up of cant expressions, having an English or
Scotch ground-work, and only patched up so as to be unintelligible
to the common hearer. There is nothing else
occurs to me by which I can be of service to your enquiry.
My own opinion leads me to think that the Gipsies have a
distinct and proper language, but I do not consider it is
extensive enough to form any settled conclusion. If there
occur any facts which I can be supposed to know, on which
you desire information, I will be willing to give them, in
illustration of so curious an enquiry. I have found them, in
general, civil and amenable to reason; I must, nevertheless,
add that they are vindictive, and that, as the knowledge
of their language is the secret which their habits and ignorance
make them tenacious of, I think your researches,
unless conducted with great prudence, may possibly expose
you to personal danger. For the same reason, you ought
to complete all the information you can collect, before
alarming them by a premature publication, as, after you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
have published, there will be great obstructions to future
communications on the subject.&#8221;</p>

<p>From what has been said, it will be seen that the following
investigation has had quite a different object than a
description of the manners and habits of the common vagrants
of the country; for no possible entertainment could have
been derived from such an undignified undertaking. And
yet many of our youth, although otherwise well informed,
have never made this distinction; owing, no doubt, to the
encreased attention which those in power have, in late years,
bestowed on the internal affairs of the country, and the
unseen, but no less surely felt, pressure of the advancement
of the general mass, and especially of the lower classes
of the community, forcing many of these people into positions
beyond the observation of those unacquainted with
their language and traits of character. When it is, therefore,
considered, that the body treated of, is originally an
exotic, comprising, I am satisfied, no less than five thousand
souls in Scotland,<a name="FNanchor19" id="FNanchor19"></a><a href="#Footnote19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> speaking an original and peculiar language,
which is mysteriously used among themselves with
great secrecy, and differing so widely from the ordinary natives
of the soil, it may well claim some little portion of public
attention. A further importance attaches to the subject,
when it is considered that a proportionate number is to be
found in the other divisions of the British Isles, and large
hordes in all parts of Europe, and more or less in every
other part of the world; in all places speaking the same
language, with only a slight difference in dialect, and manifesting
the same peculiarities. In using the language of Dr.
Bright, it may be said, that the circumstance is the most
singular phenomenon in the history of man; much more
striking, indeed, than that of the Jews. For the Jews have
been favoured with the most splendid antecedents; a common
parentage; a common history; a special and exclusive
revelation; a deeply rooted religious prejudice, and antipathy;
a common persecution; and whatever might appear
necessary to preserve their identity in the world, excepting
an isolated territorial and political existence.<a name="FNanchor20" id="FNanchor20"></a><a href="#Footnote20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The Gipsies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
on the other hand, have had none of these advantages. But
it is certain that the leaders of their bands, in addition to
their piteous representations, must have had something striking
about them, to recommend them to the favourable notice
which they seem to have met with, at the hands of some of
the sovereigns of Europe, when they made their appearance
there, and spread over its surface. Still, their assumptions
might, and in all probability did, rest merely upon an amount
of general superiority of character, of a particular kind,
without even the first elements of education, which in that
age would amount to something; a leading feature of character
which their chiefs have ever since maintained; and
yet, although everything has been left by them to tradition,
the Gipsies speak their language much better than the Jews.</p>

<p>Gipsies and Jews have many things in common. They
are both strangers and sojourners, in a sense, wherever they
are to be found; &#8220;dwelling in tents,&#8221; the one literally, the
other figuratively. They have each undergone many bloody
persecutions; the one for his stubborn blindness to the advent
of the Messiah, the other for being a heathen, and
worse than a heathen&mdash;for being nothing at all, but linked
with the evil one, in all manner of witchcraft and sin.
Each race has had many crimes brought against it; the
Gipsy, those of a positive, and the Jew, those of a constructive
and arbitrary nature. But in these respects they
differ: the Jew has been known and famed for doing almost
anything for money; and the Gipsy for the mere gratification
of his most innate nature&mdash;that of appropriating to
himself, when he needs it, that which is claimed by any out
of the circle of his consanguinity. The one&#8217;s soul is given
to accumulating, and, if it is in his power, he becomes rich;
the other more commonly aims at securing what meets his
ordinary wants, and, perhaps, some little thing additional;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
or, if he prove otherwise, he liberally spends what he acquires.
The Gipsy is humane to a stranger, when he has
been rightly appealed to; but when that circumstance is
wanting, he will never hesitate to rob him, unless when he
stands indebted to him, or, it may be, his immediate relations,
for previous acts of kindness. To indulge his hatred towards
an enemy, a Jew will oppress him, if he is his debtor,
&#8220;exacting his bond;&#8221; or if he is not his debtor, he will often
endeavour to get him to become such, with the same motive;
or it may be, if his enemy stands in need of accommodation,
he will not supply his wants; at other times, if he is poor,
he will ostentatiously make a display of his wealth, to spite
him; and, in carrying out his vengeance, will sometimes display
the malignity, barring, perhaps, the shedding of blood,
of almost every other race combined. In such a case, a
Gipsy will rob, burn, maltreat, maim, carry off a child, and
sometimes murder, but not often the two last at the present
day.<a name="FNanchor21" id="FNanchor21"></a><a href="#Footnote21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The two races are to be found side by side, in
countries characterized by almost every degree of climate
and stage of civilization, each displaying its peculiar type of
feature, but differing in this respect, that the Gipsies readily
adopt others into their tribe, at such a tender age as to
secure an infallible attachment to their race and habits.
This circumstance has produced, in many instances, a change
in the colour of the hair and eyes of the descendants of
those adopted. In some such cases, it requires an intimate
knowledge of the body, to detect the peculiarity common to
all, and especially in those who have conformed to the ways
of the other inhabitants. In this they agree&mdash;that they despise
and hate, and are despised and hated by, those among
whom they live. But in this they differ&mdash;that the Jew entered
Europe, as it were, singly and by stealth, pursuing
pretty much the avocations he yet follows; but the Gipsies,
in bands, and openly, although they were forced to betake
themselves to places of retreat, and break up into smaller
bands. It is true that the Jew was driven from his home
eighteen centuries ago, and that it is not yet five since the
Gipsy appeared in Europe. We know who the Jew is, and
something of the providence and circumstances under which
he suffers, and what future awaits him; but who is this singular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and unfortunate exile, whose origin and cause of banishment
none can comprehend&mdash;who is this wandering Gipsy?</p>

<p>After the receipt of the second of Sir Walter Scott&#8217;s
letters, already alluded to, I discontinued the few short articles
I had written for Blackwood, on the Fifeshire Gipsies;
but I have incorporated the most interesting part of them
into the work, forming, however, only a small part of the
whole. Since it was written, I have seen Mr. Borrow on
the Gipsies in Spain, and the short report of the Rev. Mr.
Baird, to the Scottish Church Society; the latter printed in
1840, and the former in 1841. The <i>Gitanos</i> in Spain and
the <i>Tinklers</i> in Scotland are, in almost every particular, the
same people, while the Yetholm Gipsy words in Mr. Baird&#8217;s
report and those collected by me, for the most part, between
the years 1817 and 1831, are word for word the same.</p>

<p>In submitting this work to the public, I deem it necessary
to say a word or two as to the authorities upon which the
facts contained in it rest. My authorities for those under
the heads of Fife and Linlithgowshire Gipsies, were aged and
creditable persons, who had been eye-witnesses to the greater
part of the transactions; in some cases, the particulars were
quite current in their time. The details under the head of
Gipsies who frequented Tweed-dale, Ettrick Forest, Annandale,
and the upper ward of Lanarkshire, were chiefly derived
from the memories of some of my relatives, and other
individuals of credit, who had many opportunities of observing
the manners of these wanderers, in the South of Scotland,
the greater number being confirmed by the Gipsies, on being
interrogated. The particulars under the head of the ceremonies
of marriage and divorce, and the sacrifice of horses,
were related by Gipsies, and confirmed by other undoubted
testimony, as will appear in detail. Almost every recent
occurrence and matter relative to the present condition,
employment, and number of the body, is the result of my own
personal enquiries and observations, while the whole specimens
of the language, and the facts immediately connected
therewith, were written down, with my own hand, from the
mouths of the Gipsies themselves, and confirmed, at intervals,
by others. Indeed, my chief object has been to produce facts
from an original source, in Scotland, as far as respects manners,
customs, and language, for the purpose of ascertaining
the origin of this mysterious race, and the country from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
which they have migrated; and the result, to my mind, is a
complete confirmation of Grellmann, Hoyland, and Bright,
that they are from Hindostan.</p>

<p>In writing the history of any barbarous race, if history it
can be called, the field for our observation must necessarily
be very limited. This may especially be said of a people
like the Gipsies; for, having, as a people, neither literature,
records, nor education,<a name="FNanchor22" id="FNanchor22"></a><a href="#Footnote22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> all that can be drawn together of
their history, from themselves, must be confined to that of
the present, or of such time as the freshness of their tradition
may suffice to illustrate; unless it be a few precarious
notices of them, that may have been elicited from their having
come, it may be, in violent contact with their civilized neighbours
around them. In attempting such a work, in connection
with so singular a people, the difficulties in the way of succeeding
in it are extraordinarily great, as the reader may
have perceived, from what has already been written, and as
the &#8220;blowing up,&#8221; alluded to in Mr. Laidlaw&#8217;s letter, will
illustrate, and which was as follows:</p>

<p>I had obtained some of the Gipsy language from a principal
family of the tribe, on condition of not publishing
names, or place of residence; and, at many miles&#8217; distance, I
had also obtained some particulars relative to the customs
and manners of the race, from a highly respectable farmer,
in the south of Scotland. At his farm, the family alluded
to always took up their quarters, in their periodical journeys
through the country. The farmer, without ever thinking of
the consequences, told them that I was collecting materials
for a publication on the Tinklers, in Scotland, and that everything
relative to their tribe would be given to the world.
The aged chief of the family was thrown into the greatest
distress, at the idea of the name and residence of himself
and family being made public. I received a letter from the
family, deeply lamenting that they had ever communicated a
word to me relative to their language, and stating that the old
man was like to break his heart, at his own imprudence, being
in agony at the thought of his language being published to the
world. I assured them, however, that they had no cause for
fear, as I had never so much as mentioned their names to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
their friend, the farmer, and that I would strictly adhere to
the promise I had given them. This was one of the many
instances in which I was obstructed in my labours, for, however
cautious I might personally be, others, who became in
some way or other acquainted with my object, were, from
inconsiderate meddling, the cause of many difficulties being
thrown in my way, and the consequent loss of much interesting
information. But for this unfortunate circumstance, I
am sanguine, from the method I took in managing the Gipsies,
I would have been able to collect songs, and sentences
of their language, and much more information than what
has been procured, at whatever value the reader may estimate
that; for the Gipsies are always more or less in communication
with each other, in their various divisions of the
country, especially when threatened with anything deemed
dangerous, which they circulate among themselves with astonishing
celerity.</p>

<p>Professor Wilson, in a poetical notice of Blackwood&#8217;s
Magazine, writes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;Few things more sweetly vary civil life<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Than a barbarian, savage Tinkler tale;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our friend, who on the Gipsies writes in Fife,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We verily believe promotes our sale.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And, in revising his works, in 1831, Sir Walter Scott, in a
note to Quentin Durward, says, relative to the present work:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is natural to suppose, the band, (Gipsy), as it now
exists, is much mingled with Europeans; but most of these
have been brought up from childhood among them, and
learned all their practices.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When they are in
closest contact with the ordinary peasants around them, they
still keep their language a mystery. There is little doubt,
however, that it is a dialect of the Hindostanee, from the
specimens produced by Grellmann, Hoyland, and others who
have written on the subject. But the author, (continues Sir
Walter,) has, besides their authority, personal occasion to
know, that an individual, out of mere curiosity, and availing
himself, with patience and assiduity, of such opportunities as
offered, has made himself capable of conversing with any
Gipsy whom he meets, or can, like the royal Hal, drink
with any tinker, in his own language.<a name="FNanchor23" id="FNanchor23"></a><a href="#Footnote23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The astonishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
excited among these vagrants, on finding a stranger participant
of their mystery, occasions very ludicrous scenes. It
is to be hoped this gentleman will publish the knowledge he
possesses on so singular a topic. There are prudential
reasons for postponing this disclosure at present, for, although
much more reconciled to society since they have
been less the objects of legal persecution, the Gipsies are
still a ferocious and vindictive people.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor24" id="FNanchor24"></a><a href="#Footnote24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote13" id="Footnote13"></a><a href="#FNanchor13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> The following is the article alluded to: &#8220;The following enquiries are
addressed to the author of the Gipsies in Fife, being suggested by the research
and industry which he has displayed in collecting memorials of that
vagrant race. They relate to a class of persons who, distinguished for
honest industry in a laborious and dangerous calling, have only this in
common with the Egyptian tribes, that they are not originally native of the
country which they inhabit, and are supposed still to exhibit traces of a
foreign origin.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I mean the colony of fishermen in the village of
Buckhaven, in Fife&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>&#8220;I make no apology to your respectable correspondent for engaging him
in so troublesome a research. The local antiquary, of all others, ought, in
the zeal of his calling, to feel the force of what Spencer wrote and Burke
quoted: &#8216;Love esteems no office mean.&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;Entire affection scorneth nicer
hands.&#8217; The curious collector who seeks for ancient reliques among the
ruins of ancient Rome, often pays for permission to trench or dig over
some particular piece of ground, in hopes to discover some remnant of
antiquity. Sometimes he gets only his labour, and the ridicule of having
wasted it, to pay for his pains; sometimes he finds but old bricks
and shattered pot-sherds; but sometimes also his toil is rewarded by a
valuable medal, cameo, bronze, or statue. And upon the same principle it
is, by investigating and comparing popular customs, often trivial and foolish
in themselves, that we often arrive at the means of establishing curious
and material facts in history.&#8221;</p>

<p>This extract is given for the benefit of the latter part of it, which applies
admirably to the present subject; yet falls as much short of it as the
interest in the history of an Egyptian mummy falls short of that of a living
and universally scattered race, that appears a riddle to our comprehension.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote14" id="Footnote14"></a><a href="#FNanchor14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> I sent him a specimen of forty-six words. [Many words used in Scotland,
in every day life, are evidently derived from the Gipsy, owing, doubtless,
to the singularity of the people who have used them, or the happy
peculiarity of circumstances under which they have been uttered; the
original cause of such passing current in a language, no less than that
degree of personal authority which sometimes occasions them to be adopted.
<i>Randy</i>, a disreputable word for a bold, scolding, and not over nicely worded
woman, is evidently derived from the Gipsy <i>raunie</i>, the chief of a tribe of
viragos; so that the exceptions spoken of are as likely to have been derived
from the Gipsy as <i>vice versa</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>CONTINENTAL GIPSIES.</h3>

<p>Before giving an account of the Gipsies in Scotland, I
shall, by way of introduction, briefly notice the periods of
time at which they were observed in the different states on
the continent of Europe, and point out the different periods
at which their governments found it necessary to expel them
from their respective territories. I shall also add a few
facts illustrative of the manners of the continental tribes, for
the purpose of showing that those in Scotland, England, and
Ireland, are all branches of the same stock. I shall, likewise,
add a few facts illustrative of the tribe who found
their way into England. I am indebted for my information
on the early history of the continental Gipsies, chiefly to
the works of Grellmann, Hoyland and Bright.</p>

<p>It appears that none of these wanderers had been seen in
Christendom before the year 1400.<a name="FNanchor25" id="FNanchor25"></a><a href="#Footnote25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> But, in the beginning
of the fifteenth century, this people first attracted notice,
and, within a few years after their arrival, had spread themselves
over the whole continent. The earliest mention
which is made of them, was in the years 1414 and 1417,
when they were observed in Germany. In 1418, they were
found in Switzerland; in 1422, in Italy; in 1427, they are
mentioned as being in the neighbourhood of Paris; and
about the same time, in Spain.<a name="FNanchor26" id="FNanchor26"></a><a href="#Footnote26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>They seem to have received various appellations. In
France, they were called <i>Bohemians</i>; in Holland, <i>Heydens</i>&mdash;heathens;
in some parts of Germany, and in Sweden and
Denmark, they were thought to be <i>Tartars</i>; but over Germany,
in general, they were called <i>Zigeuners</i>, a word which
means wanderers up and down. In Portugal, they received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the name of <i>Siganos</i>; in Spain, <i>Gitanos</i>; and in Italy, <i>Cingari</i>.
They were also called in Italy, Hungary, and Germany,
<i>Tziganys</i>; and in Transylvania, <i>Cyganis</i>. Among
the Turks, and other eastern nations, they were denominated
<i>Tschingenes</i>; but the Moors and Arabians applied to them,
perhaps, the most just appellation of any&mdash;<i>Charami</i>, robbers.<a name="FNanchor27" id="FNanchor27"></a><a href="#Footnote27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;When they arrived at Paris, 17th August, 1427, nearly
all of them had their ears bored, with one or two silver rings
in each, which, they said, were esteemed ornaments in their
country. The men were black, their hair curled; the women
remarkably black, and all their faces scarred.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor28" id="FNanchor28"></a><a href="#Footnote28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Dr.
Hurd, in his account of the different religions of the world,
says, that the hair of these men was &#8220;frizzled,&#8221; and that
some of the women were witches, and &#8220;had hair like a
horse&#8217;s tail.&#8221; It is, I think, to be inferred from this passage,
that the men had designedly curled their hair, and that the
hair of the females was long and coarse&mdash;not the short, woolly
hair of the African. I have, myself, seen English female
Gipsies with hair as long, coarse, and thick as a black
horse&#8217;s tail.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the time of the first appearance of the Gipsies, no
certain information seems to have been obtained as to the
country from which they came. It is, however, supposed
that they entered Europe in the south-east, probably through
Transylvania. At first, they represented themselves as
Egyptian pilgrims, and, under that character, obtained considerable
respect during half a century; being favoured by
different potentates with passports, and letters of security.
Gradually, however, they really became, or were fancied,
troublesome, and Italy, Sweden, Denmark and Germany,
successively attempted their expulsion, in the sixteenth century.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor29" id="FNanchor29"></a><a href="#Footnote29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>With the exception of Hungary and Transylvania, it is
believed that every state in Europe attempted either their
expulsion or extermination; but, notwithstanding the dreadful
severity of the numerous laws and edicts promulgated
against them, they remained in every part of Europe, in
defiance of every effort made by their respective governments
to get rid of their unwelcome guests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>&#8220;German writers say that King Ferdinand of Spain, who
esteemed it a good work to expatriate useful and profitable
subjects&mdash;Jews, and even Moorish families&mdash;could much less
be guilty of an impropriety, in laying hands on the mischievous
progeny of Gipsies. The edict for their extermination
was published in the year 1492. But, instead of passing the
boundaries, they only slunk into hiding places, and shortly
after appeared in as great numbers as before. The Emperor,
Charles V, persecuted them afresh; as did Philip II. Since
that time, they nestled in again, and were threatened with
another storm, but it blew over without taking effect.</p>

<p>&#8220;In France, Francis I passed an edict for their expulsion,
and at the assembly of the states of Orleans, in 1561,
all governors of cities received orders to drive them out
with fire and sword. Nevertheless, in process of time, they
collected again, and encreased to such a degree that, in 1612,
a new order came out for their extermination. In the year
1572, they were compelled to retire from the territories of
Milan and Parma; and, at a period somewhat earlier, they
were chased beyond the Venetian jurisdiction.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were not allowed the privilege of remaining in
Denmark, as the code of Danish law specifies: &#8216;The Tartar
Gipsies, who wander about everywhere, doing great damage
to the people, by their lies, thefts and witchcraft, shall be
taken into custody by every magistrate.&#8217; Sweden was not
more favourable, having attacked them at three different
times. A very sharp order for their expulsion came out in
1662. The diet of 1723 published a second; and that of
1727 repeated the foregoing, with additional severity.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were excluded from the Netherlands, under the
pain of death, by Charles V, and afterwards, by the United
States, in 1582. But the greatest number of sentences of
exile have been pronounced against them in Germany. The
beginning was made under Maximilian I, at the Augsburg
Diet, in 1500; and the same business occupied the attention
of the Diet in 1530, 1544, 1548, and 1551; and was also
again enforced, in the improved police regulations of Frankfort,
in 1577.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor30" id="FNanchor30"></a><a href="#Footnote30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The Germans entertained the notion that
the Gipsies were spies for the Turks. They were not allowed
to pass through, remain, or trade within the Empire. They
were ordered to quit entirely the German dominions, by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
certain day, and whoever injured them, after that period, was
considered to have committed no crime.</p>

<p>&#8220;But a general extermination never did happen, for the
law banishing them passed in one state before it was
thought of in the next, or when a like order had long become
obsolete, and sunk into oblivion. These undesirable guests
were, therefore, merely compelled to shift their quarters to
an adjoining state, where they remained till the government
began to clear them away, upon which the fugitives either
retired whence they came, or went on progressively to a
third place&mdash;thus making a continual circle.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor31" id="FNanchor31"></a><a href="#Footnote31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>That almost the whole of Christendom had been so provoked
by the conduct of the Gipsies as to have attempted
their expulsion, or rather their extermination, merely because
they were jugglers, fortune-tellers, astrologers, warlocks,
witches and impostors, is a thing not for a moment to be
supposed. I am inclined to believe that the true cause of
the promulgation of the excessively sanguinary laws and
edicts, for the extermination of the whole Gipsy nation in
Europe, must be looked for in much more serious crimes
than those mentioned; and that these greater offences can
be no other than theft and robbery, and living upon the
inhabitants of the countries through which they travelled,
at free quarters, or what we, in Scotland, call sorning.<a name="FNanchor32" id="FNanchor32"></a><a href="#Footnote32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
But, on the other hand, I am convinced that the Gipsies
have committed few murders on individuals <i>out</i> of their own
tribe. As far as our authorities go, the general character
of these people seems to have been the same, wherever they
have made their appearance on the face of the earth; and
the chief and leading feature of that extraordinary character
appears to me to have been, in general, an hereditary
propensity to theft and robbery, in men, women and children.</p>

<p>In whatever country we find the Gipsies, their manners,
habits, and cast of features are uniformly the same. Their
occupations are in every respect the same. They were, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the continent, horse-dealers, innkeepers, workers in iron,
musicians, astrologers, jugglers, and fortune-tellers by palmistry.
They are also accused of cheating, lying, and witchcraft,
and, in general, charged with being thieves and robbers.
They roam up and down the country, without any
fixed habitations, living in tents, and hawking small trifles
of merchandise for the use of the people among whom they
travel. The whole race were great frequenters of fairs.
They seldom formed matrimonial alliances out of their own
tribe.<a name="FNanchor33" id="FNanchor33"></a><a href="#Footnote33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> It will be seen, in another part of this work, that
the language of the continental Gipsies is the same as that
of those in Scotland, England and Ireland. As to the
religious opinions of the continental Gipsies, they appear to
have had none at all. It is said they were &#8220;worse than
heathens.&#8221; &#8220;It is, in reality,&#8221; says Twiss, &#8220;almost absurd
to talk of the religion of this set of people, whose moral
characters are so depraved as to make it evident they believe
in nothing capable of being a check to their passions.&#8221;
&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; adds Hoyland, &#8220;it is asserted that no Gipsy has
any idea of submission to any fixed profession of faith.&#8221; It
appears to me that, to secure to themselves protection from
the different governments, they only conformed outwardly
to the customs and religion of the country in which they
happened to reside at the time.</p>

<p>Cantemir, according to Grellmann, says that the Gipsies
are dispersed all over Moldavia, where every baron has
several families subject to him. In Wallachia and the
Sclavonian countries they are quite as numerous. In Wallachia
and Moldavia they are divided into two classes&mdash;the
princely and boyardish. The former, according to Sulzer,
amount to many thousands; but that is trifling in comparison
with the latter, as there is not a single Boyard in Wallachia
who has not at least three or four of them for slaves; the
rich have often some hundreds under their command,<a name="FNanchor34" id="FNanchor34"></a><a href="#Footnote34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Grellmann
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>divides those in Transylvania into four classes: 1st.
city Gipsies, who are the most civilized of all, and maintain
themselves by music, smith-work, selling old clothes, horse-dealing,
&amp;c.; 2d. gold-washers; 3d. tent Gipsies; and 4th.
Egyptian Gipsies. These last are more filthy, and more
addicted to stealing than any of the others. Those who
are gold-washers, in Transylvania and the Banat, have no
intercourse with others of their nation; nor do they like to
be called Gipsies. They sift gold sand in summer, and in
winter make trays and troughs, which they sell in an honest
way. They seldom beg, and more rarely steal. Dr. Clarke
says of the Wallachian Gipsies, that they are not an idle
race; they ought rather to be described as a laborious
race; and the majority honestly endeavour to earn a livelihood.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>&#8220;Bessarabia, all Turkey, Bulgaria, Greece, and Romania
swarm with Gipsies; even in Constantinople they are innumerable.
In Romania, a large tract of Mount H&aelig;mus,
which they inhabit, has acquired from them the name of
<i>Tschenghe Valken</i>&mdash;Gipsy Mountain. This district extends
from the city of Aydos quite to Phillippopolis, and contains
more Gipsies than any other province in the Turkish
empire.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were universally to be found in Italy, insomuch
that even Sicily and Sardinia were not free. But they were
most numerous in the dominions of the Church; probably
because there was the worst police, with much superstition.
By the former, they were left undisturbed; and the latter
enticed them to deceive the ignorant, as it afforded them an
opportunity of obtaining a plentiful contribution by their
fortune-telling and enchanted amulets. There was a general
law throughout Italy, that no Gipsy should remain more
than two nights in any one place. By this regulation, it is
true, no place retained its guests long; but no sooner was
one gone than another came in his room: it was a continual
circle, and quite as convenient to them as a perfect toleration
would have been. Italy rather suffered than benefited
by this law; as, by keeping these people in constant motion,
they would do more mischief there, than in places where
they were permitted to remain stationary.</p>

<p>&#8220;In Poland and Lithuania, as well as in Courland, there
are an amazing number of Gipsies. A person may live many
years in Upper Saxony, or in the districts of Hanover and
Brunswick, without seeing a single Gipsy. When one
happens to stray into a village or town, he occasions as
much disturbance as if the black gentleman with his cloven
foot appeared; he frightens children from their play, and
draws the attention of the older people, till the police get
hold of him, and make him again invisible. In some of the
provinces of the Rhine, a Gipsy is a very common sight.
Some years ago, there were such numbers of them in the
Duchy of Wurtemberg, that they were seen lying about everywhere;
but the government ordered departments of soldiers
to drive them from their holes and lurking-places throughout
the country, and then transported the congregated swarm,
in the same manner as they were treated by the Duke of
Deuxponts. In France, before the Revolution, there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
but few Gipsies, for the obvious reason that every Gipsy
who could be apprehended fell a sacrifice to the
police.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor35" id="FNanchor35"></a><a href="#Footnote35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>As regards the Gipsies of Spain, Dr. Bright remarks:
That the disposition of the Gitano is more inclined to a
fixed residence than that of the Gipsy of other countries, is
beyond doubt. The generality are the settled inhabitants of
considerable towns, and, although the occupations of some
necessarily lead them to a more vagrant life, the proportion
is small who do not consider some hovel in a suburb as a
home. &#8216;Money is in the city&mdash;not in the country,&#8217; is a saying
frequently in their mouths. In the vilest quarters of every
large town of the southern provinces, there are Gitanos living
together, sometimes occupying whole barriers. But
Seville is, perhaps, the spot in which the largest proportion
is found. Their principal occupation is the manufacture
and sale of articles of iron. Their quarters may always be
traced by the ring of the hammer and anvil, and many amass
considerable wealth. An inferior class have the exclusive
trade in second-hand articles, which they sell at the doors
of their dwellings, or at benches at the entrance of towns, or
by the sides of frequented walks. A still inferior order
wander about, mending pots, and selling tongs and other
trifling articles. In Cadiz, they monopolize the trade of
butchering, and frequently amass wealth. Others, again,
exclusively fill the office of Matador of the Bull Plaza, while
the Toreros are for the most part of the same race. Others
are employed as dressers of mules and asses; some as figure-dancers,
and many as performers in the theatre. Some gain
a livelihood by their musical talents. Dancing, singing,
music and fortune-telling are the only objects of general
pursuit for the females. Sometimes they dance in the inferior
theatres, and sing and dance in the streets. Palmistry
is one of their most productive avocations. In Seville, a
few make and sell an inferior kind of mat. Besides these,
there is a class of Gipsies in Spain who lead a vagrant life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
throughout&mdash;residing chiefly in the woods and mountains,
and known as mountaineers. These rarely visit towns, and
live by fraud and pillage. There are also others who wander
about the country&mdash;such as tinkers, dancers, singers, and
jobbers in asses and mules.</p>

<p>Bishop Pocoke, prior to 1745, mentions having met with
Gipsies in the northern part of Syria, where he found them
in great numbers, passing for Mahommedans, living in tents
or caravans, dealing in milch cows, when near towns, manufacturing
coarse carpets, and having a much better character
than their relations in Hungary or England. By the census
of the Crimea, in 1793, the population was set down at
157,125, of which 3,225 were Gipsies. Bishop Heber states
that the Persian Gipsies are of much better caste, and much
richer than those of India, Russia or England. In India, he
says, the Gipsies are the same tall, fine-limbed, bony, slender
people, with the same large, black, brilliant eyes, lowering
forehead, and long hair, curled at the extremities, which are
to be met with on a common in England. He mentions, in
his journal of travels through Bengal, having met with a
Gipsy camp on the Ganges. The women and children followed
him, begging, and had no clothes on them, except a
coarse kind of veil, thrown back from the shoulders, and a
ragged cloth, wrapped round their waists, like a petticoat.
One of the women was very pretty, and the forms of all the
three were such as a sculptor would have been glad to take
as his models.</p>

<p>Besides those in Europe, it is stated by Grellmann that
the Gipsies are also scattered over Asia, and are to be found
in the centre of Africa. In Europe alone, he supposes (in
1782), their number will amount to between seven and eight
hundred thousand. So numerous did they become in France,
that the king, in 1545, sixteen years before they were expelled
from that kingdom, entertained an idea of embodying
four thousand of them, to act as pioneers in taking Boulogne,
then in possession of England. It is impossible to ascertain,
at the present day, how many Gipsies might be even in a
parish; but, taking in the whole world, there must be an
immense number in existence.</p>

<p>About the time the Gipsies first appeared in Europe, their
chiefs, under the titles of dukes, earls, lords, counts, and
knights of Little Egypt, rode up and down the country on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
horseback, dressed in gay apparel, and attended by a train
of ragged and miserable inferiors, having, also, hawks and
hounds in their retinue. It appears to me, that the excessive
vanity of these chiefs had induced them, in imitation of the
customs of civilized society, to assume these high-sounding
European titles of honour. I have not observed, on record,
any form of government, laws or customs, by which the internal
affairs of the tribe, on the Continent, were regulated.
On these important points, if I am not mistaken, all the authors,
with the exception of Grellmann, who have written
on the Gipsies, are silent. Grellmann says of the Hungarian
Gipsies: &#8220;They still continue the custom among themselves
of dignifying certain persons, whom they make heads over
them, and call by the exalted Sclavonian title of Waywode.
To choose their Waywode, the Gipsies take the opportunity,
when a great number of them are assembled in one place,
commonly in the open field. The elected person is lifted up
three times, amidst the loudest acclamation, and confirmed
in his dignity by presents. His wife undergoes the same
ceremony. When this solemnity is performed, they separate
with great conceit, imagining themselves people of more
consequence than electors returning from the choice of an
emperor. Every one who is of a family descended from a
former Waywode is eligible; but those who are best
clothed, not very poor, of large stature, and about the middle
age, have generally the preference. The particular distinguishing
mark of dignity is a large whip, hanging over the
shoulder. His outward deportment, his walk and air, also
plainly show his head to be filled with notions of authority.&#8221;
According to the same authority, the Waywode of the Gipsies
in Courland is distinguished from the principals of the
hordes in other countries, being not only much respected by
his own people, but even by the Courland nobility. He is
esteemed a man of high rank, and is frequently to be met
with at entertainments, and card parties, in the first families,
where he is always a welcome guest. His dress is uncommonly
rich, in comparison with others of his tribe; generally
silk in summer, and constantly velvet in winter.</p>

<p>As a specimen of the manners and ferocious disposition of
the German Gipsies, so late as the year 1726, I shall here
transcribe a few extracts from an article published in Blackwood&#8217;s
Magazine, for January, 1818. This interesting article<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
is partly an abridged translation, or rather the substance,
of a German work on the Gipsies, entitled &#8220;A Circumstantial
Account of the Famous Egyptian Band of Thieves, and
Robbers, and Murderers, whose Leaders were executed at
Giessen, by Cord, and Sword, and Wheel, on the 14th and
15th November, 1726, &amp;c.&#8221; It is edited by Dr. John Benjamin
Wiessenburch, an assessor of the criminal tribunal by
which these malefactors were condemned, and published at
Frankfort and Leipsic, in the year 1727. The translator of
this work is Sir Walter Scott, who obligingly offered me the
use of his &#8220;scraps&#8221; on this subject. The following are the
details in his own words.</p>

<p>&#8220;A curious preliminary dissertation records some facts
respecting the German Gipsies, which are not uninteresting.</p>

<p>&#8220;From the authorities collected by Wiessenburch, it appears
that these wanderers first appeared in Germany during
the reign of Sigismund. The exact year has been
disputed; but it is generally placed betwixt 1416 and 1420.
They appeared in various bands, under chiefs, to whom
they acknowledged obedience, and who assumed the titles
of dukes and earls. These leaders originally affected a certain
degree of consequence, travelling well equipped, and on
horseback, and bringing hawks and hounds in their retinue.
Like John Faw, &#8216;Lord of Little Egypt,&#8217; they sometimes
succeeded in imposing upon the Germans the belief in their
very apocryphal dignity, which they assumed during their
lives, and recorded upon their tombs, as appears from three
epitaphs, quoted by Dr. Wiessenburch. One is in a convent
at Steinbach, and records that on St. Sebastians&#8217; eve, 1445,
&#8216;died the Lord Pannel, Duke of Little Egypt, and Baron of
Hirschhorn, in the same land.&#8217; A monumental inscription
at Bautmer, records the death of the &#8216;Noble Earl Peter, of
Lesser Egypt, in 1453;&#8217; and a third, at Pferz, as late as
1498, announces the death of the &#8216;high-born, Lord John,
Earl of Little Egypt, to whose soul God be gracious and
merciful.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;In describing the state of the German Gipsies, in 1726,
the author whom we are quoting gives the leading features
proper to those in other countries. Their disposition to
wandering, to idleness, to theft, to polygamy, or rather promiscuous
licence, are all commemorated; nor are the women&#8217;s
pretentions to fortune-telling, and their practice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
stealing children, omitted. Instead of travelling in very
large bands, as at their first arrival, they are described as
forming small parties, in which the females are far more
numerous than the men, and which are each under command
of a leader, chosen rather from reputation than by right of
birth. The men, unless when engaged in robbery or theft,
lead a life of absolute idleness, and are supported by what
the women can procure by begging, stealing or telling fortunes.
These resources are so scanty that they often suffer
the most severe extremities of hunger and cold. Some of
the Gipsies executed at Giessen pretended that they had
not eaten a morsel of bread for four days before they were
apprehended; yet are they so much attached to freedom,
and licence of this wandering life, that, notwithstanding its
miseries, it has not only been found impossible to reclaim
the native Gipsies, who claim it by inheritance, but even
those who, not born in that state, have associated themselves
with their bands, and become so wedded to it, as to prefer
it to all others.<a name="FNanchor36" id="FNanchor36"></a><a href="#Footnote36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;As an exception, Wiessenburch mentions some gangs,
where the men, as in Scotland, exercise the profession of
travelling smiths, or tinkers, or deal in pottery, or practise
as musicians. Finally, he notices that in Hungary the
gangs assumed their names from the countries which they
chiefly traversed, as the band of Upper Saxony, of Brandenburg,
and so forth. They resented, to extremity, any attempt
on the part of other Gipsies to intrude on their province;
and such interference often led to battles, in which they shot
each other with as little remorse as they would have done
to dogs.<a name="FNanchor37" id="FNanchor37"></a><a href="#Footnote37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> By these acts of cruelty to each other, they became
gradually familiarized with blood, as well as with
arms, to which another cause contributed, in the beginning
of the 18th century.</p>

<p>&#8220;In former times, these outcasts were not permitted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
bear arms in the service of any Christian power, but the
long wars of Louis XIV had abolished this point of delicacy;
and both in the French army, and those of the confederates,
the stoutest and boldest of the Gipsies were
occasionally enlisted, by choice or compulsion. These men
generally tired soon of the rigour of military discipline, and
escaping from their regiments on the first opportunity, went
back to their forests, with some knowledge of arms, and
habits bolder and more ferocious than those of their predecessors.
Such deserters soon become leaders among the
tribes, whose enterprises became, in proportion, more audacious
and desperate.</p>

<p>&#8220;In Germany, as in most other kingdoms of Europe,
severe laws had been directed against this vagabond people,
and the Landgraves of Hesse had not been behind-hand in
such denunciations. They were, on their arrest, branded
as vagabonds, punished with stripes, and banished from the
circle; and, in case of their return, were put to death without
mercy. These measures only served to make them desperate.
Their bands became more strong and more open
in their depredations. They often marched as strong as
fifty or a hundred armed men; bade defiance to the ordinary
police, and plundered the villages in open day;
wounded and slew the peasants, who endeavoured to protect
their property; and skirmished, in some instances successfully,
with parties of soldiers and militia, dispatched
against them. Their chiefs, on these occasions, were John
La Fortune, a determined villain, otherwise named Hemperla;
another called the Great Gallant; his brother,
Antony Alexander, called the Little Gallant; and others,
entitled Lorries, Lampert, Gabriel, &amp;c. Their ferocity
may be judged of from the following instances:</p>

<p>&#8220;On the 10th October, 1724, a land-lieutenant, or officer
of police, named Emerander, set off with two assistants to
disperse a band of Gipsies who had appeared near Hirzenhayn,
in the territory of Stolberg. He seized on two or
three stragglers whom he found in the village, and whom,
females as well as males, he seems to have treated with
much severity. Some, however, escaped to a large band
which lay in an adjacent forest, who, under command of the
Great Gallant, Hemperla, Antony Alexander, and others,
immediately put themselves in motion to rescue their comrades,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and avenge themselves of Emerander. The land-lieutenant
had the courage to ride out to meet them, with
his two attendants, at the passage of a bridge, where he
fired his pistol at the advancing gang, and called out
&#8216;charge,&#8217; as if he had been at the head of a party of cavalry.
The Gipsies, however, aware, from the report of the fugitives,
how weakly the officer was accompanied, continued to
advance to the end of the bridge, and ten or twelve, dropping
each on one knee, gave fire on Emerander, who was
then obliged to turn his horse and ride off, leaving his two
assistants to the mercy of the banditti. One of these men,
called Hempel, was instantly beaten down, and suffered,
especially at the hands of the Gipsy women, much cruel
and abominable outrage. After stripping him of every rag
of his clothes, they were about to murder the wretch outright;
but at the earnest instance of the landlord of the
inn, they contented themselves with beating him dreadfully,
and imposing on him an oath that he never more would persecute
any Gipsy, or save any <i>fleshman</i>, (dealer in human
flesh,) for so they called the officers of justice or police.<a name="FNanchor38" id="FNanchor38"></a><a href="#Footnote38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;The other assistant of Emerander made his escape.
But the principal was not so fortunate. When the Gipsies
had wrought their wicked pleasure on Hempel, they compelled
the landlord of the little inn to bring them a flagon
of brandy, in which they mingled a charge of gunpowder
and three pinches of salt; and each, partaking of this singular
beverage, took a solemn oath that they would stand
by each other until they had cut thongs, as they expressed
it, out of the fleshman&#8217;s hide. The Great Gallant at the
same time distributed to them, out of a little box, billets,
which each was directed to swallow, and which were supposed
to render them invulnerable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thus inflamed and encouraged, the whole route, amounting
to fifty well armed men, besides women armed with
clubs and axes, set off with horrid screams to a neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
hamlet, called Glazhutte, in which the object of their
resentment sought refuge. They took military possession
of the streets, posting sentinels to prevent interruption or
attack from the alarmed inhabitants. Their leaders then
presented themselves before the inn, and demanded that
Emerander should be delivered up to them. When the innkeeper
endeavoured to elude their demand, they forced their
way into the house, and finding the unhappy object of pursuit
concealed in a garret, Hemperla and others fired their
muskets at him, then tore his clothes from his body, and precipitated
him down the staircase, where he was dispatched
with many wounds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Meanwhile, the inhabitants of the village began to take
to arms; and one of them attempted to ring the alarm-bell,
but was prevented by an armed Gipsy, stationed for that
purpose. At length their bloody work being ended, the
Gipsies assembled and retreated out of the town, with shouts
of triumph, exclaiming that the fleshman was slain, displaying
their spoils and hands stained with blood, and headed
by the Great Gallant, riding on the horse of the murdered
officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall select from the volume another instance of this
people&#8217;s cruelty still more detestable, since even vengeance
or hostility could not be alleged for its stimulating cause, as
in the foregoing narrative. A country clergyman, named
Heinsius, the pastor of a village called Dorsdorff, who had
the misfortune to be accounted a man of some wealth, was
the subject of this tragedy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hemperla, already mentioned, with a band of ten Gipsies,
and a villain named Essper George, who had joined himself
with them, though not of their nation by birth, beset the
house of the unfortunate minister, with a resolution to break
in and possess themselves of his money; and if interrupted
by the peasants, to fire upon them, and repel force by force.
With this desperate intention, they surrounded the parsonage-house
at midnight; and their leader, Hemperla, having
cut a hole through the cover of the sink or gutter, endeavoured
to creep into the house through that passage, holding in his
hand a lighted torch made of straw. The daughter of the
parson chanced, however, to be up, and in the kitchen, at
this late hour, by which fortunate circumstance she escaped
the fate of her father and mother. When the Gipsy saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
there was a person in the kitchen, he drew himself back out
of the gutter, and ordered his gang to force the door, regarding
the noise which accompanied this violence as little
as if the place had been situated in a wilderness, instead of
a populous hamlet. Others of the gang were posted at the
windows of the house, to prevent the escape of the inmates.
Nevertheless, the young woman, already mentioned, let herself
down from a window which had escaped their notice,
and ran to seek assistance for her parents.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the meanwhile the Gipsies had burst open the outward
door of the house, with a beam of wood which chanced
to be lying in the court-yard. They next forced the door
of the sitting apartment, and were met by the poor clergyman,
who prayed them at least to spare his life and that of
his wife. But he spoke to men who knew no mercy; Hemperla
struck him on the breast with a torch; and receiving
the blow as a signal for death, the poor man staggered back
to the table, and sinking in a chair, leaned his head on his
hand, and expected the mortal blow. In this posture
Hemperla shot him dead with a pistol. The wife of the
clergyman endeavoured to fly, on witnessing the murder of
her husband, but was dragged back, and slain by a pistol-shot,
fired either by Essper George, or by a Gipsy called
Christian. By a crime so dreadful those murderers only
gained four silver cups, fourteen silver spoons, some trifling
articles of apparel, and about twenty-two florins in money.
They might have made more important booty, but the sentinel,
whom they left on the outside, now intimated to them
that the hamlet was alarmed, and that it was time to retire,
which they did accordingly, undisturbed and in safety.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Gipsies committed many enormities similar to those
above detailed, and arrived at such a pitch of audacity as
even to threaten the person of the Landgrave himself; an
enormity at which Dr. Wiessenburch, who never introduces
the name or titles of that prince without printing them in
letters of at least an inch long, expresses becoming horror.
This was too much to be endured. Strong detachments of
troops and militia scoured the country in different directions,
and searched the woods and caverns which served the banditti
for places of retreat. These measures were for some
time attended with little effect. The Gipsies had the advantages
of a perfect knowledge of the country, and excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
intelligence. They baffled the efforts of the officers detached
against them, and, on one or two occasions, even engaged
them with advantage. And when some females, unable to
follow the retreat of the men, were made prisoners on such
an occasion, the leaders caused it to be intimated to the
authorities at Giessen that if their women were not set at
liberty, they would murder and rob on the high roads, and
plunder and burn the country. This state of warfare lasted
from 1718 until 1726, during which period the subjects of
the Landgrave suffered the utmost hardships, as no man was
secure against nocturnal surprise of his property and person.</p>

<p>&#8220;At length, in the end of 1725, a heavy and continued
storm of snow compelled the Gipsy hordes to abandon the
woods which had long served them as a refuge, and to approach
more near to the dwellings of men. As their movements
could be traced and observed, the land-lieutenant,
Krocker, who had been an assistant to the murdered Emerander,
received intelligence of a band of Gipsies having
appeared in the district of Sohnsassenheim, at a village
called Fauerbach. Being aided by a party of soldiers and
volunteers, he had the luck to secure the whole gang, being
twelve men and women. Among these was the notorious
Hemperla, who was dragged by the heels from an oven in
which he was attempting to conceal himself. Others were
taken in the same manner, and imprisoned at Giessen, with
a view to their trial.</p>

<p>&#8220;Numerous acts of theft, and robbery, and murder were
laid to the charge of these unfortunate wretches; and, according
to the existing laws of the empire, they were interrogated
under torture. They were first tormented by means
of thumb-screws, which they did not seem greatly to regard;
the Spanish boots, or &#8216;leg-vices,&#8217; were next applied, and
seldom failed to extort confession. Hemperla alone set
both means at defiance, which induced the judges to believe
he was possessed of some spell against these agonies.
Having in vain searched his body for the supposed charm,
they caused his hair to be cut off; on which he himself observed
that, had they not done so, he could have stood the
torture for some time longer. As it was, his resolution gave
way, and he made, under the second application of the Spanish
boots, a full confession, not only of the murders of which
he was accused, but of various other crimes. While he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
in this agony, the judges had the cruelty to introduce his
mother, a noted Gipsy woman, called the crone, into the torture-chamber;
who shrieked fearfully, and tore her face with
her nails, on perceiving the condition of her son, and still
more on hearing him acknowledge his guilt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Evidence of the guilt of the other prisoners was also
obtained from their confessions, with or without torture,
and from the testimony of witnesses examined by the fiscal.
Sentence was finally passed on them, condemning four Gipsies,
among whom were Hemperla and the Little Gallant, to
be broken on the wheel, nine others to be hanged, and thirteen,
of whom the greater part were women, to be beheaded.
They underwent their doom with great firmness, upon the
14th and 15th November, 1726.</p>

<p>&#8220;The volume contains .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. some rude prints, representing
the murders committed by the Gipsies, and the manner
of their execution. There are also two prints representing
the portraits of the principal criminals, in which,
though the execution be indifferent, the Gipsy features may
be clearly traced.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leaving this view of the character of the continental
Gipsies, we may take the following as illustrative of one of
its brighter aspects. So late as the time of the celebrated
Baron Trenck, it would appear that Germany was still infested
with prodigiously large bands of Gipsies. In a
forest near Ginnen, to which he had fled, to conceal himself
from the pursuit of his persecutors, the Baron says: &#8220;Here
we fell in with a gang of Gipsies, (or rather banditti,)
amounting to four hundred men, who dragged me to their
camp. They were mostly French and Prussian deserters,
and, thinking me their equal, would force me to become one
of their band. But venturing to tell my story to their
leader, he presented me with a crown, gave us a small portion
of bread and meat, and suffered us to depart in peace,
after having been four-and-twenty hours in their company.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor39" id="FNanchor39"></a><a href="#Footnote39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>I shall conclude the notices of the continental Gipsies by
some extracts from an article published in a French periodical
work, for September, 1802, on the Gipsies of the Pyrenees;
who resemble, in many points, the inferior class of our
Scottish Tinklers, about the beginning of the French war,
more, perhaps, than those of any other country in Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>&#8220;There exists, in the department of the Eastern Pyrenees,
a people distinct from the rest of the inhabitants, of a foreign
origin, and without any settled habits. It seems to have
fixed its residence there for a considerable time. It changes
its situation, multiplies there, and never connects itself by
marriage with the other inhabitants. This people are called
Gitanos, a Spanish word which signifies Egyptians. There
are many Gitanos in Catalonia, who have similar habits to
the above-mentioned, but who are very strictly watched.
They have all the vices of those Egyptians, or Bohemians,
who formerly used to wander over the world, telling fortunes,
and living at the expense of superstition and credulity.
These Gitanos, less idle and less wanderers than their predecessors,
are afraid of publicly professing the art of fortune-tellers;
but their manner of life is scarcely different.</p>

<p>&#8220;They scatter themselves among villages, and lonesome
farms, where they steal fruit, poultry, and often even cattle;
in short, everything that is portable. They are almost always
abroad, incessantly watching an opportunity to practise
their thievery; they hide themselves with much dexterity
from the search of the police. Their women, in particular,
have an uncommon dexterity in pilfering. When they enter
a shop, they are watched with the utmost care; but with
every precaution they are not free from their rapines. They
excel, above all, in hiding the pieces of silver which are
given in exchange for gold, which they never fail to offer in
payment, and they are so well hidden that they are often
obliged to be undressed before restitution can be obtained.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Gitanos affect, externally, a great attachment to the
Catholic religion; and if one was to judge from the number
of reliques they carry about with them, one would believe
them exceedingly devout; but all who have well observed
them assure us they are as ignorant as hypocritical, and that
they practise secretly a religion of their own. It is not rare
to see their women, who have been lately brought to bed,
have their children baptized several times, in different places,
in order to obtain money from persons at their ease, whom
they choose for godfathers. Everything announces among
them that moral degradation which must necessarily attach
to a miserable, insulated caste, as strangers to society, which
only suffers it through an excess of contempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Gitanos are disgustingly filthy, and almost all covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
with rags. They have neither tables, chairs, nor beds,
but sit and eat on the ground. They are crowded in huts,
pell-mell, in straw; and their neglect of the decorum of society,
so dangerous to morals, must have the most melancholy
consequences on wretched vagabonds, abandoned to themselves.
They consequently are accused of giving themselves
up to every disorder of the most infamous debauchery, and
to respect neither the ties of blood nor the protecting laws
of the virtues of families.</p>

<p>&#8220;They feed on rotten poultry and fish, dogs and stinking
cats, which they seek for with avidity; and when this resource
fails them, they live on the entrails of animals, or
other aliments of the lowest price. They leave their meat
but a very few minutes on the fire, and the place where they
cook it exhales an infectious smell.</p>

<p>&#8220;They speak the Catalonian dialect, but they have, besides,
a language to themselves, unintelligible to the natives
of the country, from whom they are very careful to hide the
knowledge of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Gitanos are tanned like the mulattoes, of a size
above mediocrity, well formed, active, robust, supporting all
the changes of seasons, and sleeping in the open fields, whenever
their interest requires it. Their features are irregular,
and show them to belong to a transplanted race. They
have the mouth very wide, thick lips, and high cheek-bones.</p>

<p>&#8220;As the distrust they inspire causes them to be carefully
watched, it is not always possible for them to live by stealing:
they then have recourse to industry, and a trifling trade,
which seems to have been abandoned to them; they show
animals, and attend the fairs and markets, to sell or exchange
mules and asses, which they know how to procure at a cheap
rate. They are commonly cast-off animals, which they have
the art to dress up, and they are satisfied, in appearance,
with a moderate profit, which, however, is always more than
is supposed, because they feed these animals at the expense
of the farmers. They ramble all night, in order to steal
fodder; and whatever precautions may have been taken
against them, it is not possible to be always guarded against
their address.</p>

<p>&#8220;Happily the Gitanos are not murderers. It would,
without doubt, be important to examine if it is to the natural
goodness of their disposition, to their frugality, and the few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
wants they feel in their state of half savage, that is to be
attributed the sentiment that repels them from great crimes,
or if this disposition arises from their habitual state of alarm,
or from that want of courage which must be a necessary
consequence of the infamy in which they are plunged.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor40" id="FNanchor40"></a><a href="#Footnote40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

that those Gipsies or Bohemians were so many spies for the Turks;

<p>[Living at free quarters by force, or masterful begging, or &#8220;sorning,&#8221; is
surely a trifling, though troublesome, offence for the original condition of
a wandering tribe, which has so progressed as, at the present day, to fill
some of the first positions in Scotland.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p><a name="Footnote34" id="Footnote34"></a><a href="#FNanchor34"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> In the narrative of the Scottish Church Mission of Enquiry to the
Jews, in 1839, are to be found the following remarks relative to the Gipsies
of Wallachia:</p>

<p>&#8220;They are almost all slaves, bought and sold at pleasure. One was
lately sold for 200 piastres, but the general price is 500. Perhaps &pound;3 is
the average price, and the female Gipsies are sold much cheaper. The sale
is generally carried on by private bargain. The men are the best mechanics
in the country; so that smiths and masons are taken from this
class. The women are considered the best cooks, and therefore almost
every wealthy family has a Gipsy cook. Their appearance is similar to
that of the Gipsies in other countries; being all dark, with fine black eyes,
and long black hair. They have a language peculiar to themselves, and
though they seem to have no system of religion, yet are very superstitious
in observing lucky and unlucky days. They are all fond of music, both
vocal and instrumental, and excel in it. There is a class of them called the
Turkish Gipsies, who have purchased their freedom from government; but
these are few in number, and all from Turkey. Of these latter, there are
twelve families in Galatz. The men are employed as horse-dealers, and the
women in making bags, sacks, and such articles. In winter, they live in
town, almost under ground; but in summer, they pitch their tents in the
open air, for, though still within the bounds of the town, they would not
live in their winter houses during summer.&#8221;</p>

<p>That these Gipsies should be in a state of slavery is, perhaps, a more
marked exception to their race than the Indians in Spanish America were
to those found in the territories colonised by the Anglo-Saxons. The Empress
Maria Theresa could make nothing of the Gipsies in Hungary, where
they are said to be almost as little looked after as the wolves of the forest;
so that the slavery of the Gipsies in Wallachia must be of a very nominal
or mild nature, or the subjects of it must be far in excess of the demand,
if &pound;3 is the average price of a good smith or mason, and less for a good
female cook. These Wallachian Gipsies evidently prefer a master whose
property they will consider as their own, and whose protection will relieve
them from the interference and oppression of others. A slavery that is
not absolute or oppressive must gratify the vanity of the owner, and be
easily borne by a race that is semi-civilized and despised by others
around it.</p>

<p>Since the conclusion of the Russian war, the manumission of the Gipsies
of the Principalities was debated and carried by a majority of something
like thirteen against eleven; but I am not aware of its having been put in
force. They are said to have been greatly attached to the late Sultan&mdash;calling
him the &#8220;good father,&#8221; for the interest he took in them. As spies,
they rendered his generals efficient services, while contending with the
Russians on the Danube.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote35" id="Footnote35"></a><a href="#FNanchor35"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> Grellmann.&mdash;I would suppose that these severe edicts of the French
would drive the Gipsies to adopt the costume and manners of the other
inhabitants. In this way they would disappear from the public eye. The
officers of justice would of course direct their attention to what would be
understood to be Gipsies&mdash;that is tented Gipsies, or those who professed the
ways of Gipsies, such as fortune telling. I have met with a French Gipsy
in the streets of New York, engaged as a dealer in candy.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote36" id="Footnote36"></a><a href="#FNanchor36"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> The natives here alluded to were evidently Germans, married to Gipsy
women, or Germans brought up from infancy with the Gipsies, or mixed
Gipsies, taking after Germans in point of appearance.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote37" id="Footnote37"></a><a href="#FNanchor37"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> This is the only continental writer, that I am aware of, who mentions
the circumstance of the Gipsies having districts to themselves, from which
others of their race were excluded. This author also speaks of the German
Gipsies stealing children. John Bunyan admits the same practice in England,
when he compares his feelings, as a sinner, to those of a child carried
off by Gipsies. He gives the Gipsy <i>women</i> credit for this practice.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote38" id="Footnote38"></a><a href="#FNanchor38"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> Great allowance ought to be made for the conduct of these Gipsies.
Even at the present day, a Gipsy, in many parts of Germany, is not
allowed to enter a town; nor will the inhabitants permit him to live in the
street in which they dwell. He has therefore to go somewhere, and live
in some way or other. In speaking of the Gipsies, people never take
these circumstances into account. The Gipsies alluded to in the text
seem to have been very cruelly treated, in the first place, by the authorities.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

no hesitation in putting to death <i>those of their own tribe</i>. This writer also
says, that the Gipsies of the Pyrenees have a religion of their own, which
they practise <i>secretly</i>, without mentioning what this secret religion is. It

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>ENGLISH GIPSIES.</h3>

<p>The first arrival of the Gipsies in England appears to
have been about the year 1512,<a name="FNanchor41" id="FNanchor41"></a><a href="#Footnote41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> but this does not seem to
be quite certain. It is probable they may have arrived
there at an earlier period. The author from which the
fact is derived published his work in 1612, and states, generally,
that &#8220;this kind of people, about a hundred years
ago, began to gather an head, about the southern parts.
And this, I am informed and can gather, was their beginning:
Certain Egyptians, banished their country, (belike
not for their good condition,) arrived here in England;
who, for quaint tricks and devices, not known here at that
time among us, were esteemed, and held in great admiration;
insomuch that many of our English loiterers joined
with them, and in time learned their crafty cozening.</p>

<p>&#8220;The speech which they used was the right Egyptian
language, with whom our Englishmen conversing at least
learned their language. These people, continuing about
the country, and practising their cozening art, purchased
themselves great credit among the country people, and got
much by palmistry and telling of fortunes; insomuch that
they pitifully cozened poor country girls both of money,
silver spoons, and the best of their apparel, or any goods
they could make.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor42" id="FNanchor42"></a><a href="#Footnote42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>From this author it is collected they had a leader of the
name of Giles Hather, who was termed their king; and a
woman of the name of Calot was called queen. These,
riding through the country on horseback, and in strange
attire, had a pretty train after them.<a name="FNanchor43" id="FNanchor43"></a><a href="#Footnote43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>It appears, from this account, that the Gipsies had been
observed on the continent about a hundred years before
they visited England. According to Dr. Bright, they
seemed to have roamed up and down the continent of Europe,
without molestation, for about half a century, before
their true character was perfectly known. If 1512 was
really the year in which these people first set foot in England,
it would seem that the English government had not
been so easily nor so long imposed on as the kings of Scotland,
and the authorities of Europe generally. For we
find that, within about the space of ten years from this
period, they are, by the 10th chapter of the 22d Henry
VIII, denominated &#8220;an outlandish people, calling themselves
Egyptians, using no craft nor feat of merchandise,
who have come into this realm, and gone from shire to
shire, and place to place, in great company; and used great
subtlety and crafty means to deceive the people&mdash;bearing
them in hand that they, by palmistry, could tell men&#8217;s and
women&#8217;s fortunes; and so, many times, by craft and subtlety,
have deceived the people for their money; and also have
committed many heinous felonies and robberies.&#8221; As far
back as the year 1549, they had become very troublesome
in England, for, on the 22d June of that year, according to
Burnet&#8217;s History of the Reformation, &#8220;there was privy
search made through all Sussex for all vagabonds, Gipsies,
conspirators, prophesiers, players, and such like.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Gipsies in England still continued to commit numberless
thefts and robberies, in defiance of the existing
statutes; so that each succeeding law enacted against them
became severer than the one which preceded it. The following
is an extract from the 27th Henry VIII: &#8220;Whereas,
certain outlandish people, who do not profess any craft or
trade whereby to maintain themselves, but go about in
great numbers, from place to place, using insidious means to
impose on his majesty&#8217;s subjects, making them believe that
they understand the art of foretelling to men and women
their good and evil fortunes, by looking in their hands,
whereby they frequently defraud people of their money;
likewise are guilty of thefts and highway robberies: It is
hereby ordered that the said vagrants, commonly called
Egyptians, in case as thieves and rascals .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and on the
importation of any such Egyptians, he, the importer, shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
forfeit forty pounds for every trespass.&#8221; So much had the
conduct of the Gipsies exasperated the government of Queen
Elizabeth, that it was enacted, during her reign, that &#8220;If
any person, being fourteen years, whether natural born subject
or stranger, who had been seen in the fellowship of such
persons, or disguised like them, and remain with them one
month at once, or at several times, it should be felony without
benefit of clergy.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor44" id="FNanchor44"></a><a href="#Footnote44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> It would thus appear that, when
the Gipsies first arrived in England, they had not kept
their language a secret, as is now the case; for some of the
Englishmen of that period had acquired it by associating
with them.<a name="FNanchor45" id="FNanchor45"></a><a href="#Footnote45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>In carrying out the foregoing extraordinary enactments,
the public was at the expense of exporting the Gipsies to
the continent; and it may reasonably be assumed that great
numbers of these unhappy people were executed under these
sanguinary laws. A few years before the restoration of
Charles II, thirteen Gipsies were executed &#8220;at one Suffolk
assize.&#8221; This appears to have been the last instance of inflicting
the penalty of death on these unfortunate people in
England, merely because they were Gipsies.<a name="FNanchor46" id="FNanchor46"></a><a href="#Footnote46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> But although
these laws of blood are now repealed, the English Gipsies
are liable, at the present day, to be proceeded against under
the Vagrant Act; as these statutes declare all those persons
&#8220;pretending to be Gipsies, or wandering in the habit
and form of Egyptians, shall be deemed rogues and vagabonds.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the reign of Queen Elizabeth it was thought England
contained above 10,000 Gipsies; and Mr. Hoyland, in his
historical survey of these people, supposes that there are
18,000 of the race in Britain at the present day. A member
of Parliament, it is reported, stated, in the House of
Commons, that there were not less than 36,000 Gipsies in
Great Britain. I am inclined to believe that the statement
of the latter will be nearest the truth; as I am convinced
that the greater part of all those persons who traverse England
with earthenware, in carts and waggons, are a superior
class of Gipsies. Indeed, a Scottish Gipsy informed me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
that almost all those people are actually Gipsies. Now Mr.
Hoyland takes none of these potters into his account, when
he estimates the Gipsy population at only 18,000 souls.
Besides, Gipsies have informed me that Ireland contains a
great many of the tribe; many of whom are now finding
their way into Scotland.<a name="FNanchor47" id="FNanchor47"></a><a href="#Footnote47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>I am inclined to think that the greater part of the English
Gipsies live more apart from the other inhabitants of
the country, reside more in tents, and exhibit a great deal
more of their pristine manners, than their brethren do in
Scotland.<a name="FNanchor48" id="FNanchor48"></a><a href="#Footnote48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>The English Gipsies also travel in Scotland, with earthenware
in carts and waggons. A body of them, to the number
of six tents, with sixteen horses, encamped, on one occasion,
on the farm of Kingledoors, near the source of the
Tweed. They remained on the ground from Saturday night
till about ten o&#8217;clock on Monday morning, before they
struck their tents and waggons.</p>

<p>At St Boswell&#8217;s fair I once inspected a horde of English
Gipsies, encamped at the side of a hedge, on the Jedburgh
road as it enters St. Boswell&#8217;s Green. Their name was
Blewett, from the neighbourhood of Darlington. The chief
possessed two tents, two large carts laden with earthenware,
four horses and mules, and five large dogs. He was attended
by two old females and ten young children. One of the
women was the mother of fourteen, and the other the
mother of fifteen, children. This chief and the two females
were the most swarthy and barbarous looking people I ever
saw. They had, however, two beautiful children with them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
about five years of age, with light flaxen hair, and very fair
complexions. The old Gipsy women said they were twins;
but they might have been stolen from different parents, for
all that, as there was nothing about them that had the
slightest resemblance to any one of the horde that claimed
them. Apparently much care was taken of them, as they
were very cleanly and neatly kept.<a name="FNanchor49" id="FNanchor49"></a><a href="#Footnote49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>This Gipsy potter was a thick-set, stout man, above the
middle size. He was dressed in an old dark-blue frock coat,
with a profusion of black, greasy hair, which covered the
upper part of his broad shoulders. He wore a high-crowned,
narrow-brimmed, old hat, with a lock of his black hair
hanging down before each ear, in the same manner as the
Spanish Gipsies are described by Swinburn. He also wore
a pair of old full-topped boots, pressed half way down his
legs, and wrinkled about his ankles, like buskins. His visage
was remarkably dark and gloomy. He walked up and
down the market alone, without speaking to any one, with a
peculiar air of independence about him, as he twirled in his
hand, in the Gipsy manner, by way of amusement, a strong
bludgeon, about three feet long, which he held by the centre.
I happened to be speaking to a surgeon in the fair, at the
time the Gipsy passed me, when I observed to him that that
strange-looking man was a Gipsy; at which the surgeon
only laughed, and said he did not believe any such thing.
To satisfy him, I followed the Gipsy, at a little distance,
till he led me straight to his tents at the Jedburgh road
already mentioned.</p>

<p>This Gipsy band had none of their wares unpacked, nor
were they selling anything in the market. They were
cooking a lamb&#8217;s head and pluck, in a pan suspended from a
triangle of rods of iron, while beside it lay an abundance
of small potatoes, in a wooden dish. The females wore
black Gipsy bonnets. The visage of the oldest one was remarkably
long, her chin resting on her breast. These three
old Gipsies were, altogether, so dark, grim, and outlandish-looking,
that they had little or no appearance of being
natives of Britain. On enquiring if they were Gipsies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and could speak the language, the oldest female gave me
the following answer: &#8220;We are potters, and strangers in
this land. The people are civil unto us. I say, God bless
the people; God bless them all.&#8221; She spoke these words in
a decided, emphatic, and solemn tone, as if she believed
herself possessed of the power to curse or bless at pleasure.
On turning my back, to leave them, I observed them burst
out a laughing; making merry, as I supposed, at the idea of
having deceived me as to the tribe to which they belonged.</p>

<p>The following anecdote will give some idea of the manner
of life of the Gipsies in England.</p>

<p>A man, whom I knew, happened to lose his way, one dark
night, in Cambridgeshire. After wandering up and down
for some time, he observed a light, at a considerable distance
from him, within the skirts of a wood, and, being overjoyed
at the discovery, he directed his course toward it; but, before
reaching the fire, he was surprised at hearing a man, a
little way in advance, call out to him, in a loud voice, &#8220;Peace
or not peace?&#8221; The benighted traveller, glad at hearing
the sound of a human voice, immediately answered, &#8220;Peace;
I am a poor Scotchman, and have lost my way in the dark.&#8221;
&#8220;You can come forward then,&#8221; rejoined the sentinel. When
the Scotchman advanced, he found a family of Gipsies, with
only one tent; but, on being conducted further into the
wood, he was introduced to a great company of Gipsies.
They were busily employed in roasting several whole sheep&mdash;turning
their carcasses before large fires, on long wooden
poles, instead of iron spits. The racks on which the spits
turned were also made of wood, driven into the ground,
cross-ways, like the letter X. The Gipsies were exceedingly
kind to the stranger, causing him to partake of the victuals
which they had prepared for their feast. He remained with
them the whole night, eating and drinking, and dancing with
his merry entertainers, as if he had been one of themselves.
When day dawned, the Scotchman counted twelve tents
within a short distance of each other. On examining his
position, he found himself a long way out of his road; but
a party of the Gipsies voluntarily offered their services,
and went with him for several miles, and, with great kindness,
conducted him to the road from which he had wandered.</p>

<p>The crimes of some of the English Gipsies have greatly
exceeded those of the Scottish, such as the latter have been.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
The following details of the history of an English Gipsy
family are taken from a report on the prisons in Northumberland.
The writer of this report does not appear to have
been aware, however, of the family in question being Gipsies,
speaking an Oriental language, and that, according to
the custom of their tribe, a dexterous theft or robbery is
one of the most meritorious actions they can perform.</p>

<h4>&#8220;<i>Crime in Families. William Winters&#8217; Family.</i></h4>

<p>&#8220;William himself, and one of his sons, were hanged together
for murder. Another son committed an offence for
which he was sent to the hulks, and, soon after his release,
was concerned in a murder, for which he was hanged. Three
of the daughters were convicted of various offences, and the
mother was a woman of notorious bad character. The
family was a terror to the neighbourhood, and, according to
report, had been so for generations. The father, with a
woman with whom he cohabited, (himself a married man,)
was hanged for house-breaking. His first wife was a woman
of very bad character, and his second wife was transported.
One of the sons, a notorious thief, and two of the
daughters, were hanged for murder. Mr. Blake believes
that the only member of the family that turned out well was
a girl, who was taken from the father when he was in prison,
previous to execution, and brought up apart from her
brothers and sisters. The grandfather was once in a lunatic
asylum, as a madman. The father had a quarrel with one
of his sons, about the sale of some property, and shot him
dead. The mother co-habited with another man, and was
one morning found dead, with her throat cut. One of the
sons, (not already spoken of,) had a bastard child by one of
his cousins, herself of weak intellect, and, being under suspicion
of having destroyed the child, was arrested. While in
prison, however, and before the trial came on, he destroyed
himself by cutting his throat.&#8221;</p>

<p>This family, I believe, are the Winters noticed by Sir
Walter Scott, in Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine, as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;A gang (of Gipsies), of the name of Winters, long inhabited
the wastes of Northumberland, and committed many
crimes; among others, a murder upon a poor woman, with
singular atrocity, for which one of them was hung in chains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
near Tonpitt, in Reedsdale. The mortal reliques having
decayed, the lord of the manor has replaced them by a
wooden effigy, and still maintains the gibbet. The remnant
of this gang came to Scotland, about fifteen years ago, and
assumed the Roxburghshire name of Wintirip, as they found
their own something odious. They settled at a cottage
within about four miles of Earlston, and became great plagues
to the country, until they were secured, after a tight battle,
tried before the circuit court at Jedburgh, and banished
back to their native country of England. The dalesmen of
Reedwater showed great reluctance to receive these returned
emigrants. After the Sunday service at a little chapel near
Otterbourne, one of the squires rose, and, addressing the congregation,
told them they would be accounted no longer
Reedsdale men, but Reedsdale women, if they permitted this
marked and atrocious family to enter their district. The
people answered that they would not permit them to come
that way; and the proscribed family, hearing of the unanimous
resolution to oppose their passage, went more southernly,
by the heads of the Tyne, and I never heard more of
them, but I have little doubt they are all hanged.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor50" id="FNanchor50"></a><a href="#Footnote50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

earth&mdash;than in England; for there, the covered cart and the little tent are
the houses of the Gipsy; and he seldom remains more than three days in
the same place. So conducive is the climate of England to beauty, that
nowhere else is the appearance of the race so prepossessing as in that
country. Their complexion is dark, but not disagreeably so; their faces
are oval, their features regular, their foreheads rather low, and their hands
and feet small. The men are taller than the English peasantry, and far
more active. They all speak the English language with fluency, and in
their gait and demeanour are easy and graceful; in both respects standing
in striking contrast with the peasantry, who, in speech, are slow and uncouth,
and, in manner, dogged and brutal.&mdash;<i>Borrow.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote49" id="Footnote49"></a><a href="#FNanchor49"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> It does not follow, from what our author says about these two children,
that they were stolen. I have seen some of the children of English Gipsies
as fair as any Saxon. It sometimes happens that the flaxen hair of a
Gipsy child will change into raven black before he reaches manhood.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote50" id="Footnote50"></a><a href="#FNanchor50"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> It is but just to say that this family of Winters is, or at least was, the
worst kind of English Gipsies. Their name is a by-word among the race
in England. When they say, &#8220;It&#8217;s a winter morning,&#8221; they wish to express
something very bad. It is difficult to get them to admit that the
Winters belong to the tribe&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>SCOTTISH GIPSIES, DOWN TO THE YEAR 1715.</h3>

<p>That the Gipsies were in Scotland in the year 1506 is
certain, as appears by a letter of James IV, of Scotland, to
the King of Denmark, in favour of Anthonius Gawino, Earl
of Little Egypt, a Gipsy chief. But there is a tradition, recorded
in Crawford&#8217;s Peerage, that a company of Gipsies,
or Saracens, were committing depredations in Scotland before
the death of James II, which took place in 1460, being
forty-six years after the Gipsies were first observed on the
continent of Europe, and it is, therefore, probable that these
wanderers were encamped on Scottish ground before the
year 1460, above mentioned. As I am not aware of Saracens
ever having set foot in Scotland, England, or Ireland, I
am disposed to think, if there is any truth in this tradition,
it alludes to the Gipsies.<a name="FNanchor51" id="FNanchor51"></a><a href="#Footnote51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The story relates to the estate
and family of McLellan of Bombie, in Galloway, and is as
follows:</p>

<p>In the reign of James II, the Barony of Bombie was again
recovered by the McLellans, (as the tradition goes,) after
this manner: In the same reign, says our author of small
credit, (Sir George McKenzie, in his baronage M.S.,) it happened
that a company of Saracens or Gipsies, from Ireland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span><a name="FNanchor52" id="FNanchor52"></a><a href="#Footnote52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
infested the county of Galloway, whereupon the king intimated
a proclamation, bearing, that whoever should disperse
them, and bring in their captain, dead or alive, should have
the Barony of Bombie for his reward. It chanced that a
brave young gentleman, the laird of Bombie&#8217;s son, fortunated
to kill the person for which the reward was promised, and
he brought his head on the point of his sword to the king,
and thereupon he was immediately seized in the Barony of
Bombie; and to perpetuate the memory of that brave and
remarkable action, he took for his crest a Moor&#8217;s head, and
&#8216;Think on&#8217; for his motto.<a name="FNanchor53" id="FNanchor53"></a><a href="#Footnote53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>As armorial bearings were generally assumed to commemorate
facts and deeds of arms, it is likely that the crest of
the McLellans is the head of a <i>Gipsy</i> chief. In the reign
of James II, alluded to, we find &#8220;away putting of <i>sorners</i>,
(forcible obtruders,) fancied fools, vagabonds, out-liers, masterful
beggars, <i>bairds</i>, (strolling rhymers,) and such like
runners about,&#8221; is more than once enforced by acts of parliament.<a name="FNanchor54" id="FNanchor54"></a><a href="#Footnote54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>But the earliest authentic notice which has yet been discovered
of the first appearance of the Gipsies in Scotland, is
the letter of James IV, to the King of Denmark, in 1506.
At this period these vagrants represented themselves as
Egyptian pilgrims, and so far imposed on our religious and
melancholy monarch, as to procure from him a favourable
recommendation to his uncle of Denmark, in behalf of one of
these &#8220;Earls,&#8221; and his &#8220;lamentable retinue.&#8221; The following
is a translation of this curious epistle:</p>

<p>&#8220;Most illustrious, &amp;c.&mdash;Anthonius Gawino, Earl of Little
Egypt, and the other afflicted and lamentable tribe of his retinue,
whilst, through a desire of travelling, and, by command
of the Pope,<a name="FNanchor55" id="FNanchor55"></a><a href="#Footnote55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> (as he says,) pilgriming, over the Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
world, according to their custom, had lately arrived on the
frontiers of our kingdom, and implored us that we, out of
humanity, would allow him to approach our limits without
damage, and freely carry about all things, and the company
he now has. He easily obtains what the hard fortune
wretched men require. Thus he has sojourned here, (as we
have been informed,) for several months, in peaceable and
catholic manner. King and uncle, he now proposes a voyage
to Denmark to thee. But, being about to cross the ocean,
he hath requested our letters, in which we would inform
your Highness of these, and at the same time commend the
calamity of this tribe to your royal munificence. But we
believe that the fates, manners, and race of the wandering
Egyptians are better known to thee than us, because Egypt
is nearer thy kingdom, and a greater number of such men
sojourn in thy kingdom.&mdash;Most illustrious, &amp;c.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor56" id="FNanchor56"></a><a href="#Footnote56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>From 1506 to 1540, the 28th of the reign of James V,
we find that the true character of the Gipsies had not
reached the Scottish court; for, in 1540, the king of Scotland
entered into a league or treaty with &#8220;John Faw,
Lord and Earl of Little Egypt;&#8221; and a writ passed the
Privy Seal, the same year, in favour of this Prince or <i>Rajah</i>
of the Gipsies. As the public edicts in favour of this race
are extremely rare, I trust a copy of this curious document,
in this place, may not be unacceptable to the reader.<a name="FNanchor57" id="FNanchor57"></a><a href="#Footnote57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;James, by the grace of God, King of Scots: To our
sheriffs of Edinburgh, principal and within the constabulary
of Haddington, Berwick, Roxburgh, &amp;c., &amp;c.; provosts,
aldermen, and baillies of our burghs and cities of Edinburgh,
&amp;c., &amp;c., greeting: Forasmuch as it is humbly meant and
shown to us, by our loved John Faw, Lord and Earl of Little
Egypt, that whereas he obtained our letter under our great
seal, direct you all and sundry our said sheriffs, stewarts,
baillies, provosts, aldermen, and baillies of burghs, and to
all and sundry others having authority within our realm, to
assist him in execution of justice upon his company and
folk, conform to the laws of Egypt, and in punishing of all
them that rebel against him: nevertheless, as we are informed,
Sebastiane Lalow Egyptian, one of the said John&#8217;s
company, with his accomplices and partakers under written,
that is to say, Anteane Donea, Satona Fingo, Nona Finco,
Phillip Hatseyggaw, Towla Bailyow, Grasta Neyn, Geleyr
Bailyow, Bernard Beige, Demeo Matskalla (or Macskalla),
Notfaw Lawlowr, Martyn Femine, rebels and conspirators
against the said John Faw, and have removed them all
utterly out of his company, and taken from him divers sums
of money, jewels, clothes and other goods, to the quantity
of a great sum of money; and on nowise will pass home
with him, howbeit he has bidden and remained of long time
upon them, and is bound and obliged to bring home with
him all them of his company that are alive, and a testimony
of them that are dead: and as the said John has the said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Sebastiane&#8217;s obligation, made in Dunfermline before our
master household, that he and his company should remain
with him, and on nowise depart from him, as the same bears:
In contrary to the tenor of which, the said Sebastiane, by
sinister and wrong information, false relation, circumvention
of us, has purchased our writings, discharging him and the
remnant of the persons above written, his accomplices and
partakers of the said John&#8217;s company, and with his goods
taken by them from him; causes certain our lieges assist
them and their opinions, and to fortify and take their part
against the said John, their lord and master; so that he on
nowise can apprehend nor get them, to have them home
again within their own country, after the tenor of his said
bond, to his heavy damage and <i>skaith</i> (hurt), and in great
peril of losing his heritage, and expressly against justice:
Our will is, therefore, and we charge you straightly and
command that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ye and every one of you
within the bounds of your offices, command and charge all
our lieges, that none of them take upon hand to reset,
assist, fortify, supply, maintain, defend, or take part with
the said Sebastiane and his accomplices above written, for
no body&#8217;s nor other way, against the said John Faw, their
lord and master; but that they and ye, in likewise, take
and lay hands upon them wherever they may be apprehended,
and bring them to him, to be punished for their demerits,
conform to his laws; and help and fortify him to punish and
do justice upon them for their trespasses; and to that effect
lend him your prisons, stocks, fetters, and all other things
necessary thereto, as ye and each of you, and all other our
lieges, will answer to us thereupon, and under all highest
pain and charge that after may follow: So that the said
John have no cause of complaint thereupon in time coming,
nor to resort again to us to that effect, notwithstanding any
our writings, sinisterly purchased or to be purchased, by the
said Sebastiane on the contrary: And also charge all our
lieges that none of them molest, vex, unquiet, or trouble the
said John Faw and his company, in doing their lawful business,
or otherwise, within our realm, and in their passing,
remaining, or away-going forth of the same, under the pain
above written: And such-like that ye command and charge
all skippers, masters and mariners of all ships within our
realm, at all ports and havens where the said John and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
company shall happen to resort and come, to receive him
and them therein, upon their expenses, for furthering of them
forth of our realm to the parts beyond sea, as you and each
of them such-like will answer to us thereupon, and under
the pain aforesaid. Subscribed with our hand, and under
our privy seal at Falkland, the fifteenth day of February,
and of our reign the 28th year.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor58" id="FNanchor58"></a><a href="#Footnote58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>This curious league of John Faw with the Scottish king,
who acknowledges the laws and customs of the Gipsies
within his kingdom, was of very short duration. Like that
of many other favourites of princes, the credit which the
&#8220;Earl of Little Egypt&#8221; possessed at court was, the succeeding
year, completely annihilated, and that with a vengeance,
as will appear by the following order in council. The Gipsies,
quarrelling among themselves, and publicly bringing
their matters of dispute before the government, had, perhaps,
contributed to produce an enquiry into the real character
and conduct of these foreigners; verifying the ancient
adage, that a house divided against itself cannot stand.
But the immediate cause assigned for the sudden change of
mind in the king, so unfortunate for the Gipsies, is handed
down to us in the following tradition, current in Fife:</p>

<p>King James V, as he was travelling through part of his
dominions, disguised under the character of the Gaberlunzie-man,
or Guid-man of Ballangiegh, prosecuting, as was his
custom, his low and vague amours, fell in with a band of
Gipsies, in the midst of their carousals, in a cave, near
Wemyss, in Fifeshire. His majesty heartily joined in their
revels, but it was not long before a scuffle ensued, wherein
the king was very roughly handled, being in danger of his
life.<a name="FNanchor59" id="FNanchor59"></a><a href="#Footnote59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> The Gipsies, perceiving at last that he was none of
their people, and considering him a spy, treated him with
great indignity. Among other humiliating insults, they
compelled his royal majesty, as an humble servant of a Tinkler,
to carry their budgets and wallets on his back, for
several miles, until he was exhausted; and being unable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
proceed a step further, he sank under his load. He was
then dismissed with scorn and contempt by the merciless
Gipsies. Being exasperated at their cruel and contemptuous
treatment of his sacred person, and having seen a fair specimen
of their licentious manner of life, the king caused an order
in council immediately to be issued, declaring that, if <i>three</i>
Gipsies were found together, one of the three was instantly
to be seized, and forthwith hanged or shot, by any one of
his majesty&#8217;s subjects that chose to put the order in execution.</p>

<p>This tradition is noticed by the Rev. Andrew Small, in
his antiquities of Fife, in the following words. His book
came into my hands after I had written down my account
of the tradition.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, surely, this would be the last tinker that ever he
would dub (a knight). If we may judge from what happened,
one might imagine he, (James V,) would be heartily
sick of them, (tinkers,) being taken prisoner by three of them,
and compelled to stay with them several days, so that his
nobles lost all trace of him, and being also forced, not only
to lead their ass, but likewise to assist it in carrying part of
the panniers! At length he got an opportunity, when they
were bousing in a house at the east end of the village of
Milnathort, where there is now a new meeting-house built,
when he was left on the green with the ass. He contrived
to write, some way, on a slip of paper, and gave a boy half-a-crown
to run with it to Falkland, and give it to his nobles,
intimating that the guid-man of Ballangiegh was in a
state of captivity. After they got it, and knew where he
was, they were not long in being with him, although it was
fully ten miles they had to ride. Whenever he got assistance,
he caused two of the tinkers, that were most harsh
and severe to him, to be hanged immediately, and let the
third one, that was most favourable to him, go free. They
were hanged a little south-west of the village, at a place
which, from the circumstance, is called the Gallow-hill to
this day. The two skeletons were lately found after the
division of the commonty that recently took place. He also,
after this time, made a law, that whenever three tinkers, or
Gipsies, were found going together, two of them should be
hanged, and the third set at liberty.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor60" id="FNanchor60"></a><a href="#Footnote60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>The following order in council is, perhaps, the one to
which this tradition alludes:</p>

<p>&#8220;Act of the lords of council respecting John Faw, &amp;c.,
June 6, 1541. The which day anent the complaint given
by John Faw and his brother, and Sebastiane Lalow,
Egyptians, to the King&#8217;s grace, ilk ane plenizeand .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
upon other and divers faults and injuries; and that it is
agreed among them to pass home, and have the same decided
before the Duke of Egypt.<a name="FNanchor61" id="FNanchor61"></a><a href="#Footnote61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> The lords of council, being
advised with the points of the said complaints, and understanding
perfectly the great thefts and <i>skaiths</i> (hurts) done
by the said Egyptians upon our sovereign lord&#8217;s lieges, wherever
they come or resort, ordain letters to be directed to the
provosts and baillies of Edinburgh, St. Johnstown (Perth),
Dundee, Montrose, Aberdeen, St. Andrews, Elgin, Forres,
and Inverness; and to the sheriffs of Edinburgh, Fife,
Perth, Forfar, Kincardine, Aberdeen, Elgin and Forres,
Banff, Cromarty, Inverness, and all other sheriffs, stewarts,
provosts and baillies, where it happens the said Egyptians to
resort.<a name="FNanchor62" id="FNanchor62"></a><a href="#Footnote62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> To command and charge them, by open proclamation,
at the market crosses of the head burghs of the sheriffdoms,
to depart forth of this realm, with their wives, children,
and companies, within xxx days after they be charged
thereto, under the pain of death; notwithstanding any
other letters or privileges granted to them by the king&#8217;s
grace, because his grace, with the advice of the lords, has
discharged the same for the causes aforesaid: with certification
that if they be found in this realm, the said xxx days
being past, they shall be taken and put to death.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor63" id="FNanchor63"></a><a href="#Footnote63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>This sharp order in council seems to have been the first
edict banishing the Gipsies as a whole people&mdash;men, women,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and children&mdash;from Scotland. But the king, whom, according
to tradition, they had personally so deeply offended, dying
in the following year, (1542) a new reign brought new
prospects to the denounced wanderers.<a name="FNanchor64" id="FNanchor64"></a><a href="#Footnote64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> They seem to have
had the address to recover their credit with the succeeding
government; for, in 1553, the writ which passed the privy
seal in 1540, forming a sort of league with &#8220;John Faw, Lord
and Earl of Little Egypt,&#8221; was renewed by Hamilton, Earl
of Arran, then Regent during the minority of Queen Mary.
McLaurin, in his criminal trials, when speaking of John
Faw, gravely calls him &#8220;this peer.&#8221; &#8220;There is a writ,&#8221;
says he, &#8220;of the same tenor in favour of this peer from Queen
Mary, same record, 25 April, 1553; and 8 April, 1554, he
gets remission for the slaughter of Ninian Small.&#8221; In Blackwood&#8217;s
Magazine it is mentioned that &#8220;Andro Faw, Captain
of the Egyptians,<a name="FNanchor65" id="FNanchor65"></a><a href="#Footnote65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> and twelve of his gang specified by name,
obtained a remission for the slaughter of Ninian Small, committed
within the town of Linton, in the month of March
last by past upon suddenly.&#8221; This appears to be the slaughter
to which McLaurin alludes. The following are the
names of these thirteen Gipsies: &#8220;Andro Faw, captain of
the Egyptians, George Faw, Robert Faw, and Anthony Faw,
his sons, Johnne Faw, Andrew George Nichoah, George
Sebastiane Colyne, George Colyne, Julie Colyne, Johnne
Colyne, James Haw, Johnne Browne, and George Browne,
Egyptians.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the edict above mentioned, it is evident that the
Gipsies in Scotland, at that time, were allowed to punish the
criminal members of their own tribe, according to their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
peculiar laws, customs and usages, without molestation. And
it cannot be supposed that the ministers of three or four succeeding
monarchs would have suffered their sovereigns to be
so much imposed on, as to allow them to put their names to
public documents, styling poor and miserable wretches, as
we at the present day imagine them to have been, &#8220;Lords
and Earls of Little Egypt.&#8221; Judging from the accounts
which tradition has handed down to us, of the gay and fashionable
appearance of the principal Gipsies, as late as about
the beginning of the eighteenth century, as will be seen in
my account of the Tweed-dale bands, I am disposed to believe
that Anthonius Gawino, in 1506, and John Faw, in
1540, would personally, as individuals, that is, as Gipsy
Rajahs,<a name="FNanchor66" id="FNanchor66"></a><a href="#Footnote66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> have a very respectable and imposing appearance
in the eyes of the officers of the crown. And besides, John
Faw appears to have been possessed of &#8220;divers sums of
money, jewels, clothes and other goods, to the quantity of a
great sum of money;&#8221; and it would seem that some of the
officers of high rank in the household of our kings had fingered
the cash of the Gipsy pilgrims. If there is any truth
in the popular and uniform tradition that, in the seventeenth
century, a Countess of Cassilis was seduced from her duty
to her lord, and carried off by a Gipsy, of the name of John
Faa, and his band, it cannot be imagined, that the seducer
would be a poor, wretched, beggarly Tinkler, such as many
of the tribe are at this day. If a handsome person, elegant
apparel, a lively disposition, much mirth and glee, and a constant
boasting of extraordinary prowess, would in any
way contribute to make an impression on the heart of the
frail countess, these qualities, I am disposed to think, would
not be wanting in the &#8220;Gipsy Laddie.&#8221; And, moreover,
John Faw bore, on paper at least, as high a title as her
husband, Lord Cassilis, from whom she absconded. It is
said the individual who seduced the fair lady was a Sir
John Faw, of Dunbar, her former sweetheart, and not a
Gipsy; but tradition gives no account of a Sir John Faw, of
Dunbar.<a name="FNanchor67" id="FNanchor67"></a><a href="#Footnote67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The Falls, merchants, at Dunbar, were descended
from the Gipsy Faas of Yetholm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>It is pretty clear that the Gipsies remained in Scotland,
with little molestation, from 1506 till 1579&mdash;the year in
which James VI took the government into his own hands,
being a period of about seventy-three years, during which
time these wanderers roamed up and down the kingdom,
without receiving any check of consequence, excepting the
short period&mdash;probably about one year&mdash;in which the severe
order of James V remained in force, and which, in all probability,
expired with the king.<a name="FNanchor68" id="FNanchor68"></a><a href="#Footnote68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>The civil and religious contests in which the nation had
been long engaged, particularly during the reign of Queen
Mary, produced numerous swarms of banditti, who committed
outrages in every part of the country. The slighter depredations
of the Gipsy bands, in the midst of the fierce and
bloody quarrels of the different factions that generally prevailed
throughout the kingdom, would attract but little attention,
and the Gipsies would thereby escape the punishment
which their actions merited. But the government being
more firmly established, by the union of the different parties
who distracted the country, and the king assuming the supreme
authority, which all acknowledged, vigorous measures
were adopted for suppressing the excess of strolling vagabonds
of every description. In the very year the king was
placed at the head of affairs, a law was passed, &#8220;For punishment
of strong and idle beggars, and relief of the poor and
impotent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Against the Gipsies this sweeping statute is particularly
directed, for they are named, and some of their practices
pointed out, in the following passage: &#8220;And that it may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
known what manner of persons are meant to be strong and
idle beggars and vagabonds, and worthy of the punishment
before specified, it is declared that all idle persons going
about the country of this realm, using subtle, crafty and unlawful
plays&mdash;as jugglery, fast-and-loose, and such others, the
idle people calling themselves Egyptians, or any other that
fancy themselves to have knowledge of prophecy, charming,
or other abused sciences, whereby they persuade the people
that they can tell their weirds, deaths, and fortunes, and
such other fantastical imaginations.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor69" id="FNanchor69"></a><a href="#Footnote69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> And the following is
the mode prescribed for punishing the Gipsies, and the other
offenders associated with them in this act of parliament:
&#8220;That such as make themselves fools and are <i>bairds</i>, (strolling
rhymers,) or other such like runners about, being apprehended,
shall be put in the king&#8217;s ward, or irons, so long as
they have any goods of their own to live on, and if they have
not whereupon to live of their own, that their ears be nailed
to the tron or other tree, and cut off, and (themselves) banished
the country; and if thereafter they be found again,
that they be hanged.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor70" id="FNanchor70"></a><a href="#Footnote70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>This statute was ratified and confirmed in the 12th parliament
of James VI, cap. 147, 5th June, 1592, wherein the
incorrigible Gipsies are again referred to: &#8220;And for the
better trial of common <i>sorners</i> (forcible obtruders,) vagabonds,
and masterful beggars, fancied fools, and counterfeit
Egyptians, and to the effect that they may be still preserved
till they be compelled to settle at some certain
dwelling, or be expelled forth of the country, &amp;c.&#8221;
The next law in which the Gipsies are mentioned, with
other vagabonds, was passed in the 15th parliament of the
same reign, 19th December, 1597, entitled, &#8220;Strong beggars,
vagabonds, and Egyptians should be punished.&#8221; The
statute itself reads as follows: &#8220;Our sovereign lord and estates
of parliament ratify and approve the acts of parliament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
made before, against strong and idle beggars, vagabonds,
and Egyptians,&#8221; with this addition: &#8220;That strong beggars
and their children be employed in common works, and their
service mentioned in the said act of parliament, in the year
of God, 1579, to be prorogate in during their life times, &amp;c.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor71" id="FNanchor71"></a><a href="#Footnote71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>All the foregoing laws were again ratified and enforced
by another act, in the same reign, 15th November, 1600.
The following extract will serve to give some explanation
how these statutes were neglected, and seldom put in force:
&#8220;And how the said acts have received little or no effect or
execution, by the oversight and negligence of the persons
who were nominated justices and commissioners, for putting
of the said acts to full and due execution, so that the strong
and idle beggars, being for the most part thieves, <i>bairds</i>,
(strolling rhymers,) and counterfeit <i>limmers</i>, (scoundrels,)
living most insolently and ungodly, without marriage or baptism,
are suffered to <i>vaig</i> and wander throughout the whole
country.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor72" id="FNanchor72"></a><a href="#Footnote72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> &#8220;But,&#8221; says Baron Hume, &#8220;all ordinary means
having proved insufficient to restrain so numerous and so
sturdy a crew, the privy council at length, in June, 1603,
were induced to venture on the more effectual expedient,
(recommended by the example of some other realm,) of at
once ordering the whole race to leave the kingdom by a certain
day, and never to return under the pain of death.<a name="FNanchor73" id="FNanchor73"></a><a href="#Footnote73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> A
few years after, this proclamation was converted into perpetual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
law, by statute 1609, cap. 13, with this farther convenient,
but very severe, provision toward the more effectual
execution of the order, that it should be lawful to condemn
and execute them to the death, upon proof made of the single
fact &#8216;that they are called, known, repute and holden Egyptians&#8217;!&#8221;
As this is the only statute exclusively relating to,
and denouncing, the Gipsies, I shall give it at length.</p>

<p>&#8220;13. Act anent the Egyptians. Our sovereign lord and
estates of parliament ratify, approve, and perpetually confirm
the act of secret council, made in the month of June or
thereby, 1603 years, and proclamation following thereupon,
commanding the vagabonds, <i>sorners</i> (forcible obtruders), and
common thieves, commonly called Egyptians, to pass forth
of this kingdom, and remain perpetually forth thereof, and
never to return within the same, under pain of death; and
that the same have force and execution after the first day
of August next to come. After the which time, if any of
the said vagabonds, called Egyptians, as well women as
men, shall be found within this kingdom, or any part thereof,
it shall be lawful to all his majesty&#8217;s good subjects, or
any one of them, to cause take, apprehend, imprison, and
execute to death the said Egyptians, either men or women,
as common, notorious, and condemned thieves, by one assize
only to be tried, that they are called, known, repute and
holden Egyptians: In the which cause, whosoever of the
assize happen to <i>clenge</i> (exculpate) any of the aforesaid
Egyptians pannelled, as said is, shall be pursued, handled
and censured as committers of wilful error: And whoever
shall, any time thereafter, reset, receive, supply, or entertain
any of the said Egyptians, either men or women, shall lose
their escheat, and be warded at the judge&#8217;s will: And that
the sheriffs and magistrates, in whose bounds they shall publicly
and avowedly resort and remain, be called before the
lords of his highness&#8217; secret council, and severely censured
and punished for their negligence in execution of this act:
Discharging all letters, protections, and warrants whatsoever,
purchased by the said Egyptians, or any of them, from his
majesty or lords of secret council, for their remaining within
this realm, as surreptitiously and deceitfully obtained by
their knowledge: Annulling also all warrants purchased,
or hereafter to be purchased, by any subject of whatsoever
rank within this kingdom, for their reset, entertaining, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
doing any manner of favour to the said Egyptians, at any
time after the said first day of August next to come, for now
and ever.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor74" id="FNanchor74"></a><a href="#Footnote74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> In a subsequent enactment, in 1617, appointing
justices of the peace and constables, the destruction of
the proscribed Egyptians is particularly enjoined, in defining
the different duties of the magistrates and their peace
officers.<a name="FNanchor75" id="FNanchor75"></a><a href="#Footnote75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>But so little respected was the authority of the government,
that in 1612, three years after the passing of the
Gipsy act, his majesty was under the humiliating necessity
of entering into a contract with the clan Scott, and their
friends, by which the clan bound themselves &#8220;to give up all
bands of friendship, kindness, oversight, maintenance or assurance,
if any we have, with common thieves and broken
clans, &amp;c.&#8221; It is certain there would be many bonds of the
same nature with other turbulent clans throughout the kingdom.
That Scotchmen of respectability and influence protected
the Gipsies, and afforded them shelter on their lands,
after the promulgation of the cruel statute of 1609, is manifest
from the following passages, which I extract from Blackwood&#8217;s
Magazine, for 1817; the conductor of which seems
to have been careful in examining the public records for the
documents quoted by him; having been guided in his researches,
I believe, by Sir Walter Scott.</p>

<p>&#8220;In February, 1615, we find a remission under the privy
seal, granted to William Auchterlony, of Cayrine, for resetting
of John Faw and his followers.<a name="FNanchor76" id="FNanchor76"></a><a href="#Footnote76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> On the 14th July,
1616, the sheriff of Forfar is severely reprimanded for delaying
to execute some Gipsies, who had been taken within his
jurisdiction, and for troubling the council with petitions in
their behalf. In November following appears a proclamation
against Egyptians and their resetters. In December,
1619, we find another proclamation against resetters of them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
in April, 1620, another proclamation of the same kind, and
in July, 1620, a commission against resetters, all with very
severe penalties. The nature of these acts will be better
understood from the following extract from that of the 4th
July, 1616, which also very well explains the way in which
the Gipsies contrived to maintain their footing in the country,
in defiance of all the efforts of the legislature to extirpate
them.&#8221; &#8220;It is of truth that the thieves and <i>limmers</i>
(scoundrels), aforesaid, having for some short space after the
said act of parliament, (1609,) .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dispersed themselves
in certain secret and obscure places of the country .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
they were not known to wander abroad in troops and companies,
according to their accustomed manner, yet, shortly
thereafter, finding that the said act of parliament was neglected,
and that no enquiry nor .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was made for
them, they began to take new breath and courage, and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
unite themselves in infamous companies and societies, under
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. commanders, and continually since then have remained
within the country, committing as well open and
avowed <i>rieffis</i> (robberies) in all parts .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. murders,
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>pleine stouthe</i> (common theft) and pickery, where
they may not be mastered; and they do shamefully and mischievously
abuse the simple and ignorant people, by telling
fortunes, and using charms, and a number of juggling tricks
and falseties, unworthy to be heard of in a country subject
to religion, law, and justice; and they are encouraged to
remain within the country, and to continue in their thievish
and juggling tricks and falseties, not only through default
of the execution of the said act of parliament, but, what is
worse, that great numbers of his majesty&#8217;s subjects, of whom
some outwardly pretend to be famous and unspotted gentlemen,
have given and give open and avowed protection, reset,
supply and maintainance, upon their grounds and lands, to
the said vagabonds, <i>sorners</i>, (forcible obtruders,) and condemned
thieves and <i>limmers</i>, (scoundrels,) and suffer them to
remain days, weeks, and months together thereupon, without
controulment, and with connivance and oversight, &amp;c.&#8221; &#8220;So
they do leave a foul, infamous, and ignominious spot upon
them, their houses, and posterity, that they are patrons to
thieves and <i>limmers</i>, (scoundrels,)&#8221; &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor77" id="FNanchor77"></a><a href="#Footnote77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>From their first arrival in the country till 1579, the Gipsies,
as already mentioned, appear to have been treated as a
separate people, observing their own laws and customs. In
the year 1587, such was the state of society in Scotland,
that laws were passed by James VI, compelling all the
baronial proprietors of lands, chiefs and captains of clans,
on the Borders and Highlands of Scotland, to find pledges
and securities for the peaceable conduct of their retainers,
tenants, clansmen, and other inhabitants of their respective
estates and districts.<a name="FNanchor78" id="FNanchor78"></a><a href="#Footnote78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> In the same parliament another act
was passed, allowing vagabonds and broken and unpledged
men to produce pledges and securities for their good conduct.
The Gipsies, under these statutes, would remain unmolested,
as they would readily find protection by becoming,
nominally, clansmen, and assuming the surnames, of those
chieftains and noblemen who were willing and able to afford
them protection.<a name="FNanchor79" id="FNanchor79"></a><a href="#Footnote79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Indeed, the act allowing vagabonds to
find sureties would include the Gipsy bands, for, about this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
period, they seem to have been only classed with our own
native vagabonds, moss-troopers, Border and Highland
thieves, broken clans and masterless men. It appears by
the act of 1609, that the Gipsies had even purchased their
protection from the government. The inhabitants of Scotland
being at this period still divided into clans, would
greatly facilitate the escape of the Gipsies from the laws
passed against them. The clans on the Borders and Highlands
were in a state of almost constant warfare with one
another; and frequently several of the clans were united in
opposition to the regular government of the country, to
whose mandates they paid little or no regard. The Gipsies
had no settled residence, but roamed from place to place
over the whole country; and when they found themselves
in danger in one place, they had no more to do but remove
into the district inhabited by a hostile clan, where they
would immediately find protection. Besides, the Borderers
and Highlanders, themselves plunderers and thieves, would
not be very active in apprehending their brother thieves,
the Gipsies. Even, according to Holinshed, &#8220;the poison of
theft and robbery pervaded almost all classes of the Scottish
community about this period.&#8221;</p>

<p>The excessive severity of the sanguinary statute of 1609,
and the unrelenting manner in which it was often carried
into effect, were calculated to produce a great outward
change on the Scottish Gipsies. Like stags selected from a
herd of deer, and doomed to be hunted down by dogs, these
wanderers were now singled out, and separated from the
community, as objects to whom no mercy was to be shown.<a name="FNanchor80" id="FNanchor80"></a><a href="#Footnote80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
The word Egyptian would never be allowed to escape their
lips; not a syllable of their peculiar speech would be uttered,
unless in the midst of their own tribe. It is also highly
probable that every part of their dress by which their fraternity
could be recognized, would be carefully discontinued.
To deceive the public, they would also conform <i>externally</i>
to some of the religious rites, ceremonies, observances, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
other customs of the natives of Scotland. I am further inclined
to think that it would be about this period, and chiefly
in consequence of these bloody enactments, the Gipsies
would, in general, assume the ordinary christian and surnames
common at that time in Scotland. And their usual
sagacity pointed out to them the advantages arising from
taking the cognomens of the most powerful families in
the kingdom, whose influence would afford them ample
protection, as adopted members of their respective clans.
In support of my opinion of the origin of the surnames of
the Gipsies of the present day, we find that the most prevailing
names among them are those of the most influential
of our noble families of Scotland; such as Stewart, Gordon,
Douglas, Graham, Ruthven, Hamilton, Drummond, Kennedy,
Cunningham, Montgomery, Kerr, Campbell, Maxwell, Johnstone,
Ogilvie, McDonald, Robertson, Grant, Baillie, Shaw,
Burnet, Brown, Keith, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor81" id="FNanchor81"></a><a href="#Footnote81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> If, even at the present day,
you enquire at the Gipsies respecting their descent, the
greater part of them will tell you that they are sprung
from a bastard son of this or that noble family, or other
person of rank and influence, of their own surname.<a name="FNanchor82" id="FNanchor82"></a><a href="#Footnote82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> This
pretended connexion with families of high rank and power
has saved some of the tribe from the gallows even in our own
time. The names, however, of the two principal families,
Faw, (now Faa,) and Bailyow, (now Baillie,) appear not to
have been changed since the date of the order in council or
league with James V, in the year 1540, as both of these
names are inserted in that document.</p>

<p>Baron Hume, on the criminal law of Scotland, gives the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
following account of some of the trials and executions of
the Gipsies:</p>

<p>&#8220;The statute (1609) annuls at the same time all protection
and warrants purchased by the Egyptians from his majesty&#8217;s
privy council, for their remaining within the realm; as also
all privileges purchased by any person to reset, entertain, or
do them any favour. It appears, indeed, from a paper in
the appendix to McLaurin&#8217;s Cases, that even the king&#8217;s servants
and great officers had not kept their hands entirely
pure of this sort of treaty with the Egyptian chiefs, from
whom some supply of money might in this way be occasionally
obtained.</p>

<p>&#8220;The first Gipsies that were brought to trial on the
statute, were four persons of the name of Faa, who, on the
31st July, 1611, were sentenced to be hanged. They had
pleaded upon a special license from the privy council, to
abide within the country; but this appearing to be clogged
with a condition of finding surety for their appearance
when called on, and their surety being actually at the horn,
for failure to present themselves, they were held to have infringed
the terms of their protection.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next trial was on the 19th and 24th July, 1616, in
the case of other two Faas and a Baillie, (which seem to
have been noted names among the Gipsies;) and here was
started that plea which has since been repeated in almost
every case, but has always been overruled, viz: that the act
and proclamation were temporary ordinances, and applicable
only to such Egyptians as were in the country at their date.
These pannels, upon conviction, were ordered by the privy
council to find caution to the extent of 1,000 merks, to leave
Scotland and never to return; and having failed to comply
with this injunction, they were in consequence condemned to
die.</p>

<p>&#8220;In January, 1624, follows a still more severe example;
no fewer than eight men, among whom Captain John Faa
and other five of the name of Faa, being convicted, were
doomed to death on the statute. Some days after, there
were brought to trial Helen Faa, relict of Captain Faa,
Lucretia Faa, and other women to the number of eleven; all
of whom were in like manner convicted, and condemned to
be drowned! But, in the end, their doom was commuted
for banishment, (under pain of death,) to them and all their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
race. The sentence was, however, executed on the male
convicts; and it appears that the terror of their fate had
been of material service; as, for the space of more than 50
years from that time, there is no trial of an Egyptian.&#8221;</p>

<p>But notwithstanding this statement of Baron Hume, of
the Gipsy trials having ceased for half a century, we find,
twelve years after 1624, the date of the above trials, the
following order of the privy council: &#8220;Anent some Egyptians.
At Edinburgh, 10th November, 1636. Forasmuch as Sir
Arthur Douglas of Quhittinghame having lately taken and
apprehended some of the vagabond and counterfeit thieves
and <i>limmers</i>, (scoundrels,) called the Egyptians, he presented
and delivered them to the sheriff principal of the sheriffdom
of Edinburgh, within the constabulary of Haddington,
where they have remained this month or thereby: and
whereas the keeping of them longer, within the said tolbooth,
is troublesome and burdensome to the town of Haddington,
and fosters the said thieves in an opinion of impunity, to
the encouraging of the rest of that infamous <i>byke</i> (hive) of
lawless <i>limmers</i> (scoundrels) to continue in their thievish
trade: Therefore the lords of secret council ordain the
sheriff of Haddington, or his deputies, to pronounce doom
and sentence of death against so many of these counterfeit
thieves as are men, and against so many of the women as
want children; ordaining the men to be hanged, and the
women to be drowned; and that such of the women as have
children, to be scourged through the burgh of Haddington,
and burned in the cheek; and ordain and command the
provost and baillies of Haddington to cause this doom be
executed upon the said persons accordingly.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor83" id="FNanchor83"></a><a href="#Footnote83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Towards the end of that century,&#8221; continues Baron
Hume, &#8220;the nuisance seems to have again become troublesome.
On the 13th of December, 1698, John Baillie and
six men more of the same name, along with the wife of one
of them, were indicted as Egyptians, and also for sundry
special misdeeds; and being convicted, (all but the woman,)
they were ordered for execution. But in this case it is to
be remarked, that the court had so far departed from the
rigour of the statute as not to sustain a relevancy on the
habit and repute of being an Egyptian of itself, but only
&#8216;along with one or other of the facts of picking and little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
thieving;&#8217; thus requiring some proof of actual guilt in aid
of the fame. In the next trial, which was that of William
Baillie, June 26th, 1699, a still further indulgence was introduced;
for the interlocutor required a proof, not of <i>one</i>
only, but of <i>several</i>, of the facts of &#8216;picking or little thieving,
or of several acts of beating and striking with invasive
weapons.&#8217; He was only convicted as an Egyptian, and of
<i>one</i> act of striking with an invasive weapon, and he escaped
in consequence with his life.</p>

<p>&#8220;This lenient course of dealing with the Gipsies was not
taken, however, from any opinion of it as a necessary thing,
nor was there any purpose of prescribing it as a rule for
other times, or for further cases of the kind where such an
indulgence might seem improper, as appears from the interlocutor
of relevancy in the case of John Kerr, and Helen
Yorkston, and William Baillie and other seven; in both of
which the simple fame and character of being an Egyptian
is again found <i>separatum</i> relevant to infer the pain of death,
(10th and 11th August, 1714.) Kerr and Yorkston had a
verdict in their favour; Baillie and two of his associates
were condemned to die; but as far as concerns Baillie, (for
the others were executed,) his doom was afterwards mitigated
into transportation, under pain of death in case of return.</p>

<p>&#8220;As early as the month of August, 1715, the same man, (as
I understand it,) was again indicted, not only for being
found in Britain, but for continuing his former practices and
course of life. Notwithstanding this aggravation, the interlocutor
is again framed on the indulgent plan, and only infers
the pain of death, from the fame and character of being
an Egyptian, joined with various acts of violence and sorning,
to the number of three, that are stated in the libel.
Though convicted nearly to the extent of the interlocutor,
he again escaped with transportation.<a name="FNanchor84" id="FNanchor84"></a><a href="#Footnote84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Nor have I observed that the court, in any later case,
have thought it necessary to proceed upon the repute alone,
unavouched by evidence of, at least, one act of theft or violence;
so that, upon the whole, according to the practice of
later times, this sort of charge seems to be reduced nearly
to the level of the charge of being habit and repute a thief
at common law.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>It is noticed by Baron Hume that the Faas and the Baillies
were noted names among the Gipsies. Indeed, the
trials referred to by him are all of persons bearing these two
surnames, except two individuals only. The truth is, the
Faas and the Baillies were the two principal families among
the Gipsies; giving, according to their customs, kings and
queens to their countrymen in Scotland. They would be
more bold, daring, and presumptuous in their conduct than
the most part of their followers; and, being leaders of the
banditti, government, in all probability, would fix upon them
as the most proper objects for destruction, as the best and
easiest method of overawing and dispersing the whole tribe
in the country, by cutting off their chiefs. As I have already
mentioned, these two principal clans of Faw and Bailyow
appear to be the only Gipsy families in Scotland who have
retained the original surnames of their ancestors, at least of
those whose names are inserted in the treaty with James V,
in 1540.</p>

<p>It will be seen, under the head Tweed-dale and Clydesdale
Gipsies, that tradition has represented William Baillie, who
was tried in 1714 and 1715, as a bastard son of the ancient
family of Lamington, (his mother being a Gipsy). It appears
to me that the Gipsy policy of joining themselves to some
family of rank was, in Baillie&#8217;s case, of very important service,
not only to himself but to the whole tribe in Scotland.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span><a name="FNanchor85" id="FNanchor85"></a><a href="#Footnote85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
The extraordinary lenity shown to him by the court, after
such repeated aggravation, cannot be accounted for in any
other way than that great interest had been used in his behalf,
in some quarter or other; and that, by creating a merciful
precedent in his case, it was afterwards followed in the
trial of all others of the race in Scotland.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote51" id="Footnote51"></a><a href="#FNanchor51"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> There is no reason to doubt that these were Gipsies. They were evidently
a roving band, from some of the continental hordes, that had passed
over into Scotland, to &#8220;prospect&#8221; and plunder. They would, very naturally,
be called Saracens by the natives of Scotland, to whom any black
people, at that time, would appear as Saracens. We may, therefore, assume
that the Gipsies have been fully four hundred years in Scotland. I may
mention, however, that Mediterranean corsairs occasionally landed and
plundered on the British coast, to as late a period as the reign of Charles
I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote52" id="Footnote52"></a><a href="#FNanchor52"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> Almost all the Scottish Gipsies assert that their ancestors came by
way of Ireland into Scotland.</p>

<p>[This is extremely likely. On the publication of the edict of Ferdinand
of Spain, in 1492, some of the Spanish Gipsies would likely pass over to the
south of Ireland, and thence find their way into Scotland, before 1506.
Anthonius Gawino, above referred to, would almost seem to be a Spanish
name. We may, therefore, very safely assume that the Gipsies of Scotland
are of Spanish Gipsy descent.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p><a name="Footnote55" id="Footnote55"></a><a href="#FNanchor55"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> Mr. Hoyland makes some very judicious remarks upon the capacity of
the Gipsies, when they first appeared in Europe. He says: &#8220;The first of
this people who came into Europe must have been persons of discernment
and discrimination, to have adapted their deceptions so exactly to the genius
and habits of the different people they visited, as to ensure success in all
countries. The stratagem to which they had recourse, on entering France,
evinces consummate artifice of plan, and not a little adroitness and dexterity
in the execution. The specious appearance of submission to Papal
authority, in the penance of wandering seven years, without lying in a bed,
contained three distinct objects. They could not have devised an expedient
more likely to recommend them to the favour of the ecclesiastics, or better
concerted for taking advantage of the superstitious credulity of the people,
and, at the same time, for securing to themselves the gratification of their
own nomadic propensities. So complete was the deception they practised,
that we find they wandered up and down France, under the eye of the magistracy,
not for seven years only, but for more than a hundred years, without
molestation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Hoyland&#8217;s remarks cover only half of the question, for, being &#8220;pilgrims,&#8221;
their chiefs must also assume very high titles, to give them consideration
with the rulers of Europe&mdash;such as dukes, earls, lords, counts
and knights. To carry out the character of pilgrims, the body would go
very poorly clad; it would only be the chiefs who would be flashily accoutred.
It is, therefore, by no means wonderful that the Gipsies should have
succeeded so well, and so long, in obtaining an entrance, and a toleration,
in every country of Europe.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

to McLaurin&#8217;s Criminal Trials.</p>

<p>This document may well be termed the most curious and important record
of the early history of the Gipsy race in Europe; and it is well worthy of
consideration. The meaning of it is simply this: John Faw had evidently
been importuned by the Scottish Court, (at which he appears to have been
a man of no small consequence,) to bring his so-called &#8220;pilgrimage,&#8221; which
he had undertaken &#8220;by command of the Pope,&#8221; to an end, so far, at least,
as remaining in Scotland was concerned. Being pressed upon the point,
he evidently, as a last resource, formed a plan with Sebastiane Lalow, and
the other &#8220;rebels,&#8221; to leave him, and carry <i>off</i>, (as he said,) his property.
To give the action an air of importance, and make it appear as a real rebellion,
they brought the question into court. Then, John could turn round,
and reply to the king: &#8220;May it please your majesty! I can&#8217;t return to
my own country. My company and folk have conspired, rebelled, robbed,
and left me. I can&#8217;t lay my hands upon them; I don&#8217;t even know where
to find them. I must take them home with me, or a testimony of them
that are dead, under the great peril of losing my heritage, at the hands of
my lord, the Duke of Egypt. However, if your majesty will help me to
catch them, I will not be long in taking leave of <i>your</i> kingdom, with all
my company. In the meantime, your majesty will be pleased to issue
your commands to all the shipowners and mariners in the kingdom, to be
ready, <i>when I gather together my folk(!)</i> to further our passage to Egypt,
for which I will pay them handsomely.&#8221; The whole business may be
termed a piece of &#8220;thimble-rigging,&#8221; to prolong their stay&mdash;that is, enable
them to remain permanently&mdash;in the country. Our author, I think, is quite
in error in supposing this to have been a real quarrel among the Gipsies.
If it had been a real quarrel, the Gipsies would soon have settled the question
among themselves, by their own laws; it would have been the last
thing, under all the circumstances of the case, they would have thought
of, to have brought it before the Scottish court. The Gipsies, according
to Grellmann, assigned the following reason for prolonging their stay in
Europe: &#8220;They endeavoured to prolong the term (of their pilgrimage) by
asserting that their return home was prevented by soldiers, stationed to
intercept them; and by wishing to have it believed that new parties of
pilgrims were to leave their country every year, otherwise their land would
be rendered totally barren.&#8221;</p>

<p>The quarrel between the Faas and the Baillies, for the <i>Gipsy crown</i>, in
after times, did not, in all probability, arise from this business, but most
likely, as the English Gipsies believe, from some marriage between these
families. The Scottish Gipsies, like the two Roses, have had, and for aught
I know to the contrary, may have yet, two rival kings&mdash;Faa and Baillie,
with their partisans&mdash;although the Faas, from the prominent position which
they have always occupied in Scottish history, have been the only kings
known to the Scottish public generally.</p>

<p>In perusing this work, the reader will be pleased to take the above mentioned
document as the starting point of the history of the Gipsies in
Scotland; and consider the Gipsies of that time as the progenitors of all
those at present in Scotland, including the great encrease of the body, by
the mixture of the white blood that has been brought within their community.
He will also be pleased to divest himself of the childish prejudices,
acquired in the nursery and in general literature, against the name
of Gipsy; and consider that there are people in Scotland, occupying some
of the highest positions in life, who are Gipsies; not indeed Gipsies in point
of purity of blood, but people who have Gipsy blood in their veins, and
who hold themselves to be Gipsies, in the manner which I have, to a certain
extent, explained in the <a href="#Page_5">Preface</a>, and will more fully illustrate in my
<a href="#Page_371">Disquisition</a> on the Gipsies.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote59" id="Footnote59"></a><a href="#FNanchor59"><span class="label">[59]</span></a> The Gipsies assert that, on this occasion, the king attempted to take

<p><a name="Footnote61" id="Footnote61"></a><a href="#FNanchor61"><span class="label">[61]</span></a> It would seem that John Faw had become frightened at the mishap of one
of his folk &#8220;coming crack over the king&#8217;s head with a bottle,&#8221; and that, to
pacify his majesty, he had at once gone before him, and informed him that
he had prevailed on his &#8220;rebellious subjects&#8221; to <i>pass home</i>, and have the
matter in dispute decided by the <i>Duke of Egypt</i>. This would, so far, satisfy
the king; but to make sure of getting rid of his troublesome visitors, he
issued his commands to the various authorities to see that they really did
leave the country.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote62" id="Footnote62"></a><a href="#FNanchor62"><span class="label">[62]</span></a> It would appear, from the mention that is made here of the authorities
of so many towns and counties, &#8220;where it happens the said Egyptians to
resort,&#8221; that the race was scattered over all Scotland at this time, and that
it must have been numerous.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote64" id="Footnote64"></a><a href="#FNanchor64"><span class="label">[64]</span></a> It is perfectly evident that the severe decree of James V against the
Gipsies arose from the personal insult alluded to, owing to the circumstance
of its falling to the ground after his death, and the Gipsies recovering their
position with his successor. Apart from what the Gipsies themselves say
on this subject, the ordinary tradition may be assumed to be well founded.
If the Gipsies were spoken to on the subject of the insult offered to the
king, they would naturally reply, that they did not know, from his having
been dressed like a beggar, that it was the king; an excuse which the court,
knowing his majesty&#8217;s vagabond habits, would probably receive. But it
is very likely that John Faw would declare that the guilty parties were
those rebels whom he was desirous to catch, and take home with him to
Egypt! This Gipsy king seems to have been a master of diplomacy.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote65" id="Footnote65"></a><a href="#FNanchor65"><span class="label">[65]</span></a> The Gipsy chiefs were partial to the title of Captain; arising, I suppose,
from their being leaders of large bands of young men employed in theft
and robbery. [In Spain, such Gipsy chiefs, according to Mr. Borrow, assumed
the name of Counts.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p><a name="Footnote67" id="Footnote67"></a><a href="#FNanchor67"><span class="label">[67]</span></a> The author, (Mr. Finlay,) who claims a Sir John Faw, of Dunbar, to
have been the person who carried off the Countess of Cassilis, gives no authority,
as a writer in Blackwood says, in support of his assertion. Nor
does he account for a person of that name being any other than a Gipsy.
Indeed, this is but an instance of the ignorance and prejudice of people generally
in regard to the Gipsies. The tradition of the hero being a Gipsy,
I have met with among the English Gipsies, who even gave me the name
of the lady. John Faw, in all probability the king of the Gipsies, who carried
off the countess, might reasonably be assumed to have been, in point
of education, on a par with her, who, in that respect, would not, in all probability,
rise above the most humble Scotch cow-milker at the present day,
whatever her personal bearing might have been.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote68" id="Footnote68"></a><a href="#FNanchor68"><span class="label">[68]</span></a> During these seventy-three years of peace, the Gipsies in Scotland
must have multiplied prodigiously, and, in all probability, drawn much of
the native blood into their body. Not being, at that time, a proscribed
race, but, on the contrary, honoured by leagues and covenants with the
king himself, the ignorant public generally would have few of those objections
to intermarry with them, which they have had in subsequent times.
The thieving habits of the Gipsies would prove no bar to such connections,
as the Scottish people were accustomed to thieving of all kinds.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote69" id="Footnote69"></a><a href="#FNanchor69"><span class="label">[69]</span></a> In this act of parliament are denounced, along with the Gipsies, &#8220;all
minstrels, songsters, and tale-tellers, not avowed by special licence of some
of the lords of parliament or great barons, or by the high burghs and
cities, for their common minstrels.&#8221; &#8220;All <i>vagabond scholars</i>(<i>!</i>) of the universities
of St Andrews, Glasgow, and Aberdeen, not licenced by the rector
and dean of faculty to <i>ask alms</i>.&#8221; It would seem, from this last extract,
that the Scottish Universities granted diplomas to their students to beg!
The Gipsies were associated or classed with good company at this time.
But beggar students, or student-beggars, were common in other parts of
Europe during that age.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

&#8220;Coal and salt-masters might apprehend, and put to labour, all vagabonds
and sturdy beggars.&#8221; The truth is, these kidnapped individuals and their
children were made slaves of to these masters. The colliers were emancipated
only within these fifty years. It has been stated to me that some of
the colliers in the Lothians are of Gipsy extraction. [Our author might
have said <i>Gipsies</i>; for being &#8220;of Gipsy extraction,&#8221; and &#8220;Gipsies,&#8221; are expressions
quite synonymous, notwithstanding the application by the public
of the latter term to the more original kind of Gipsies only.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p><a name="Footnote72" id="Footnote72"></a><a href="#FNanchor72"><span class="label">[72]</span></a> If Fletcher of Saltoun be correct, when he states that, in his time, which
was about the end of the 17th century, there were two hundred thousand
people, (about one-fifth of the whole population,) begging from door to door
in Scotland, it would be a task of no little difficulty, for those in power, to
put in force the laws against the Gipsies, and vagabonds generally. The
editor of Dr. Pennicuick&#8217;s history of Tweed-dale, thinks Fletcher&#8217;s is an
over-charged picture. Some are of opinion that, when he made his statement,
he included the greater part of the inhabitants of the Scottish Border,
and also those in the north of Scotland; for, he said, the Highlands &#8220;was an
inexhaustible source of beggars,&#8221; and wished these banditti transplanted
to the low country, and to people the Highlands from hence.</p>

The pardon is granted &#8220;pro receptione, supportatione, et detentione supra

Regist. secreti sigilli vol. lxxxiii, fol. 291, <i>Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote77" id="Footnote77"></a><a href="#FNanchor77"><span class="label">[77]</span></a> The same state of things existed in Spain. Charles II. passed a law
on the 12th June, 1695, the 16th article of which, as given by Mr. Borrow,
enacts: &#8220;And because we understand that the continuance of those who
are called Gitanos has depended on the favour, protection, and assistance
which they have experienced from persons of <i>different stations</i>, we do ordain
that whosoever against whom shall be proved the fact of having, since the
day of the publication hereof, favoured, received, or assisted the said
Gitanos, in any manner whatever, whether <i>within their houses</i> or without,
<i>provided he is a noble</i>, shall be subjected to the fine of <i>six thousand ducats</i>,
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and <i>if a plebeian</i>, to a <i>punishment of ten years in the galleys</i>.&#8221;
Such an enactment would surely prove that the Gipsies in Spain were
<i>greatly</i> favoured by the Spanish people generally, even two centuries after
they entered the country.</p>

<p>The causes to which may be attributed this toleration, even encouragement,
of the Gipsies, are various. Among these may be mentioned a fear
of consequences to person and property, tinkering, trafficking and amusement,
and corruption on the part of those in power. But in the character
of the Gipsies itself may be found a general cause for their escaping the
effects of the laws passed against them, viz., <i>wheedling</i>. The term Gitano
has been variously modified in the Spanish language, thus:</p>

<p>Gitano. <i>Gipsy</i>, <i>flatterer</i>; Gitanillo, <i>a little Gipsy</i>; Gitanismo, <i>the Gipsy
tribe</i>; Gitanesco, <i>Gipsy-like</i>; Gitanear, <i>to flatter</i>, <i>entice</i>; Gitaneria, <i>wheedling</i>,
<i>flattery</i>; Gitanamento, <i>in a sly, winning manner</i>; Gitanada, <i>blandishment</i>,
<i>wheedling</i>, <i>flattery</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote78" id="Footnote78"></a><a href="#FNanchor78"><span class="label">[78]</span></a> There were 17 clans on the Borders, and 34 clans in the Highlands,
who appear to have had chiefs and captains over them. There were 22
baronial proprietors connected with the Borders, and 106 connected with
the Highlands, named in a roll, who were likewise ordered to find pledges.&mdash;<i>Glendook&#8217;s
Scots Acts.</i></p>

<p><a name="Footnote79" id="Footnote79"></a><a href="#FNanchor79"><span class="label">[79]</span></a> It sometimes happened, when an internal quarrel took place in a clan,
portions of the tribe left their chief, and united themselves to another, whose
name they assumed and dropped their original one.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote80" id="Footnote80"></a><a href="#FNanchor80"><span class="label">[80]</span></a> The reader will see that the Gipsies, at this time, were not greater
&#8220;vagabonds&#8221; than great numbers of native Scotch, if as great. But, being
strangers in the country, sojourners according to their own account, the
king would naturally enough banish them, as they seem always to have
been saying that they were about leaving for &#8220;their own country.&#8221; Their
living in tents, a mode of life so different from that of the natives, would,
of itself, make them obnoxious to the king personally.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote81" id="Footnote81"></a><a href="#FNanchor81"><span class="label">[81]</span></a> The English Gipsies say that native names were assumed by their
race in consequence of the proscription to which it was subjected. German
Gipsies, on arrival in America, change, at least modify, their names. There
are many of them who go under the names of Smith, Miller, and Waggoner.
Jews frequently bear names common to the natives of the countries
in which they are to be found, and sometimes, at the present day, assume
Christian ones. I knew two German Jews, of the name of Cohen, who
settled in Scotland. One of them, who was a priest, retained the original
name; but the other, who was a watchmaker, assumed the name of Cowan,
which, singularly enough, the priest said, was a corruption of Cohen.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote82" id="Footnote82"></a><a href="#FNanchor82"><span class="label">[82]</span></a> It is stated by Paget, in his Travels in Hungary, that the Gipsies in
that country have a profound regard for aristocracy; and that they invariably
follow that class in the matter of religious opinions. Grellmann
says as much in regard to the Gipsy&#8217;s desire of getting hold of a distinguished
old coat to put on his person.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

the chapter of <a href="#Page_185">Tweed-dale and Clydesdale Gipsies</a>.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote85" id="Footnote85"></a><a href="#FNanchor85"><span class="label">[85]</span></a> From the time of arrival of the Gipsies in the country, in 1506, till
1611, the date of the first trials of the tribe, as given by Baron Hume, a
period of 105 years had elapsed; during which time there had doubtless
been five generations of Gipsies added to the population, as Scottish subjects;
to put whom to death, on the mere ground of being Egyptians, was contrary
to every principle of natural justice. The cruelty exercised upon
them was quite in keeping with that of reducing to slavery the individuals,
and their descendants, who constituted the colliers, coal-bearers, and salters
referred to in the following interesting note, to be found in &#8220;My Schools
and Schoolmasters,&#8221; of Hugh Miller.</p>

<p>&#8220;The act for manumitting our Scotch colliers was passed in the year
1775, forty-nine years prior to the date of my acquaintance with the class of
Niddry. But though it was only such colliers of the village as were in
their fiftieth year when I knew them, (with, of course, all the older ones,)
who had been born slaves, even its men of thirty had actually, though not
nominally, come into the world in a state of bondage, in consequence of
certain penalties attached to the emancipation act, of which the poor ignorant
workers under ground were both too improvident and too little ingenious
to keep clear. They were set free, however, by a second act passed
in 1799. The language of both these acts, regarded as British ones of the
latter half of the last century, and as bearing reference to British subjects
living within the limits of the island, strikes with startling effect. &#8216;Whereas,&#8217;
says the preamble of the older act&mdash;that of 1775&mdash;&#8216;by the statute law of
Scotland, as explained by the judges of the courts of law there, many colliers,
and coal-bearers, and salters, are in a state of <i>slavery or bondage</i>,
bound to the collieries or salt works, where they work <i>for life, transferable
with the collieries or salt works</i>; and whereas, the emancipation,&#8217; &amp;c., &amp;c. A
passage in the preamble of the act of 1799 is scarcely less striking: it declares
that, notwithstanding the former act, &#8216;many colliers and coal-bearers
<i>still continue in a state of bondage</i>&#8217; in Scotland. The history of our Scotch
colliers would be found a curious and instructive one. Their slavery seems
not to have been derived from the ancient time of general serfship, but to
have originated in comparatively modern acts of the Scottish Parliament,
and in decisions of the Court of Session&mdash;in acts of Parliament in which
the poor ignorant subterranean men of the country were, of course, wholly
unrepresented, and in decisions of a court in which no agent of theirs ever
made appearance in their behalf.&#8221;</p>

<p>What is here said of a history of Scotch colliers being &#8220;curious and instructive,&#8221;
is applicable in an infinitely greater degree to that of the Gipsies.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>LINLITHGOWSHIRE GIPSIES.<a name="FNanchor86" id="FNanchor86"></a><a href="#Footnote86" class="fnanchor"
style="font-size: 70%; font-weight: normal;">[86]</a></h3>

<p>The Gipsies who frequented the banks of the Forth, and
the counties northward, appear to have been more daring
than those who visited some other parts of Scotland.</p>

<p>Within these sixty years, a large horde, of very desperate
character, resided on the banks of the Avon, near the burgh
of Linlithgow. At first, they quartered higher up on the
Stirling side of the stream, at a place called Walkmilton;
but latterly they took up their abode in some old houses, on
the Linlithgow side of the river, at or near the bridge of
Linlithgow.</p>

<p>These Gipsies displayed much sagacity in carrying on their
trade, by selecting the neighbourhood of Falkirk and Linlithgow
for their headquarters, as this was, perhaps, the most
advantageous position in all Scotland that a Gipsy band
could occupy. The district was of itself very populous, and
a very considerable trade and bustle then existed at the port
of Bo&#8217;ness, in the vicinity. All the intercourse between
Edinburgh and Glasgow passed a few miles to the south of
their quarters. The traffic, by carts, between Glasgow and
the west of Scotland, and the shipping at Carron-shore, Elphingston-Pow
and Airth, on the Forth, before the canal was
cut, was immense; all which traffic, as well as that between
Fife and the western districts, passed a few miles north of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
their position. The road for travellers and cattle from the
Highlands, by way of Stirling, crossed the above-mentioned
roads, and led, through Falkirk and Linlithgow, to Edinburgh,
the eastern and southern counties of Scotland, and
England.</p>

<p>The principal surnames of this Gipsy band were McDonald,
Jamieson, Wilson, Gordon and Lundie. Frequently the
number that would assemble together would amount to upwards
of thirty souls, and it was often observed that a great
many females and children were seen loitering about their
common place of residence. No protection was given by
them to our native vagrants, nor were any of our common
plunderers, vagabonds, or outlaws suffered to remain among
them. When at home, or traversing the country, the trade
and occupation of this band were exactly the same as those
of their friends in other parts of Scotland, viz: making wool-cards,
cast-iron soles for ploughs, smoothing-irons, horn
spoons, and repairing articles in the tinker line. The old
females told fortunes, while the women in general assisted
their husbands in their work, by blowing the bellows, scraping
and polishing the spoons with glass and charred wood,
and otherwise completing their articles for sale. Many of
the males dealt in horses, with which they frequented fairs&mdash;that
great resort of the Gipsies; and these wanderers, in
general, were considered excellent judges of horses. Numbers
of them were fiddlers and pipers, and the tribe often
amused themselves with feasting and dancing.<a name="FNanchor87" id="FNanchor87"></a><a href="#Footnote87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>Like their race generally, these Gipsies were extremely
civil and obliging to their immediate neighbours, and those
who lived nearest to their quarters, and had the most intercourse
with them, in the ordinary affairs of life, were the
least afraid of them.<a name="FNanchor88" id="FNanchor88"></a><a href="#Footnote88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> But the farmers and others at a distance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
who frequented the markets at Falkirk, and other
fairs in the neighbourhood, were always a plentiful harvest
for the plundering Tinklers. Their plunderings on such
occasions spread a general alarm over the country. But
that good humour, mirth, and jocund disposition, peculiar to
many of the males of the Gipsies, seldom failed to gain the
good-will of those who deigned to converse with them with
familiarity, or treated them with kindness. They even
formed strong attachments to certain individuals of the community,
and afforded them protection on all occasions, giving
them tokens to present to others of their fraternity, while
travelling under night. Notwithstanding the good disposition
which they always showed under these circumstances,
the fiery Tinklers often fell out among themselves, on dividing,
at home, the booty which they had collected at fairs,
and excited feelings of horror in the minds of their astonished
neighbours, when they beheld the hurricanes of wrath
and fury exhibited by both sexes, and all ages, in the heat
of their battles.</p>

<p>The children of these Gipsies attended the principal school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
at Linlithgow, and not an individual at the school dared to
cast the slightest reflection on, or speak a disrespectful word
of, either them or their parents, although their robberies were
everywhere notorious, yet always conducted in so artful a
manner that no direct evidence could ever be obtained of
them. Such was the fear that the audacious conduct of
these Gipsies inspired, that the magistrates of the royal
burgh of Linlithgow stood in awe of them, and were deterred
from discharging their magisterial duties, when any matter
relative to their conduct came before their honours. The
truth is, the magistrates would not interfere with them at all,
but stood nearly on the same terms with them that a tribe
of American Indians, who worshipped the devil&mdash;not from
any respect which they had for his Satanic majesty, but from
being in constant dread of his diabolical machinations. Not
a justice of the peace gave the horde the least annoyance,
but, on the contrary, allowed them to remain in peaceable
possession of some old, uninhabited houses, to which they
had no right whatever. Instead of endeavouring to repress
the unlawful proceedings of the daring Tinklers, numbers
of the most respectable individuals in Linlithgowshire
deigned to play at golf and other games with the principal
members of the body. The proficiency which the Gipsies
displayed on such occasions was always a source of interest
to the patrons and admirers of such games. At throwing
the sledge-hammer, casting the putting-stone, and all other
athletic exercises, not one was a match for these powerful
Tinklers. They were also remarkably dexterous at handling
the cudgel, at which they were constantly practising
themselves.</p>

<p>The honourable magistrates, indeed, frequently admitted
the presumptuous Tinklers to share a social bowl with them
at their entertainments and dinner parties. Yet these
friends and companions of the magistrates and gentlemen of
Linlithgowshire were no other than the occasional tenants
of kilns, or temporary occupiers of the ground floor of some
ruinous, half-roofed houses, without furniture, saving a few
blankets and some straw, to prevent their persons from resting
upon the cold earth. But, nevertheless, these Gipsies
made themselves of considerable importance, and possessed
an influence over the minds of the community to an extent
hardly to be credited at the present day. It was well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
known that the provost of Linlithgow, who was much exposed
by riding at all times through the country, in the way
of his business as a brewer, had himself received from the
Gipsies assurance that he would not be molested by the
band, and that he was, therefore, at all times, and on all occasions,
perfectly safe from being plundered. Having in
this manner rendered the local authorities entirely passive,
or rather neutral, from fear and interest, the audacious Gipsies
prosecuted their system of plunder and robbery to an
alarming extent.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fear which these Gipsies inspired in
the mind of the community, there were yet individuals of
courage who would brave them, if circumstances rendered a
meeting with them unavoidable. None, indeed, would dream
of wantonly molesting them, but, if brought to the pinch,
some would not shrink from encountering them, when acting
under the influences of those feelings which call forth the
latent courage of even the most timid and considerate of
people. Such a rencounter resulted in the death of the
chief of the Linlithgow band, of the name of McDonald, to
whom the others of the tribe gave the title of captain.</p>

<p>In a dark night, a gentleman of the name of H&mdash;&mdash;, an
officer in the army, and a man of courage, while travelling
on the high road, from the eastward to Stirlingshire, to visit,
as was said, his sweetheart, had occasion to stop, for refreshment,
at a public-house near the bridge of Linlithgow. The
landlord advised him to go no further that night, owing to
the road being &#8220;foul,&#8221; meaning that the Tinklers had been
seen lurking in the direction in which he was travelling.
Foul or not foul, he would proceed; his particular engagement
with the lady making him reluctant to break his promise,
and turn back. He called for a gill of brandy, which
he shared with the landlord, and deliberately loaded, in his
presence, a brace of pistols which he carried about his person.
His courage rose with the occasion, and he declared
that whoever dared to molest him should not go unpunished.
He then mounted his horse and rode forward. On arriving
at a place called Sandy-ford-burn, a man, in the dark, sprang
out from the side of the road, and, laying hold of the bridle
of his horse, demanded his money. The horseman being on
the alert, and quite prepared for such a demand, with his
spirits, moreover, elevated by his dram of brandy, instantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
replied by firing one of his pistols at the robber, who fell
to the ground. He, however, held fast the bridle reins in
his convulsive death grasp, and the horse, being urged forward,
dragged him a short distance along the ground.
Hardly had the shot been fired, ere a voice, close by, was
heard to exclaim, &#8220;There goes our captain,&#8221; while a confused
cry of vengeance was uttered on all sides, against him
by whom he had fallen. But the rider, clapping his spurs
to his horse, instantly galloped forward, yet made a narrow
escape, for several shots were fired at him, which were heard
by the landlord of the public-house which he had just left.</p>

<p>The Gipsies, in this awkward predicament, carried the
body of their chieftain home, and gave out to their neighbours,
the country people, the following morning, (Sunday,)
that he had died very suddenly of iliac passion. His lyke-wake
was kept up in their usual manner, and great feastings
and drinkings were held by them while his body lay uninterred.
After several days of carousing, the remains of the
robber were buried in the church-yard of Linlithgow.<a name="FNanchor89" id="FNanchor89"></a><a href="#Footnote89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> His
funeral was very respectable, having been attended by the
magistrates of Linlithgow, and a number of the most genteel
persons in the neighbourhood. The real cause of the sudden
death of the Tinkler began to spread abroad, a short
time after the burial, but no enquiry was made into the matter.
The individual who had done the public a service, by
taking off the chief of the banditti, mentioned the circumstance
afterwards to his friends, and was afraid of the band
for some time thereafter; although it was improbable that,
in the dark, they were able to make out, or afterwards ascertain,
the person who had made himself so obnoxious to them.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this prompt and well-merited chastisement
which the Gipsies received, in their leader being shot
dead in his attempt at highway robbery, in the immediate
vicinity of their ordinary place of rendezvous, they continued
their depredations in their usual manner, but generally
took care, as is their custom, to give no molestation to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
nearest neighbours. The deceased captain was succeeded, in
the chieftainship of the tribe, by his son, Alexander McDonald,
who also assumed the title of captain. This man
trod in the footsteps of his father in every respect, and exercised
his hereditary profession of theft and robbery, with
an activity and audacity unequalled by any among his tribe
in that part of Scotland. The very name of McDonald
and his gang appalled the boldest hearts of those who ventured
to travel under night with money in their pockets, in
certain parts of the country. His band appears to have
been very numerous, as among them some held the subordinate
rank of lieutenants, as if they had been organized like
a regular military company. James Jamieson, his brother-in-law,
was also styled captain in this notorious band of
Gipsies, who were connected with similar bands in England
and Ireland.</p>

<p>McDonald and his brother-in-law, Jamieson, were considered
remarkably stout, handsome, and fine-looking men.
By constant training at all kinds of athletic exercises, they
brought themselves to perform feats of bodily strength and
agility which were almost incredible. They were often
elegantly dressed in the finest clothes of the first fashion,
with linen to correspond. At the same time they were perfect
chameleons in respect to their appearance and apparel.
McDonald was frequently observed in three or four different
dresses in one market-day. At one time of the day, he was
seen completely attired in the best of tartan, assuming the
appearance and manners of a highland gentleman in full costume.
At another time, he appeared ruffled at hands and
breast, booted and spurred, on horseback, as if he had been
a man of some consideration. He would again be seen in a
ragged coat, with a budget and wallet on his back&mdash;a common
travelling Tinkler. Both of these men often dealt in
horses, and were themselves frequently mounted on the best
of animals. The Arabians and Tartars are scarcely more
partial to horses than the Gipsies.</p>

<p>The pranks and tricks played by McDonald were numerous,
and many a story is yet remembered of his extraordinary
exploits. He took great pains in training and learning
some of his horses various evolutions and tricks. He had,
at one time, a piebald horse so efficiently trained, and so
completely under his management, that it, in some respects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
assisted him in his depredations. By certain signals and
motions, he could, when he found it necessary, make it clap
close to the ground, like a hare in its furrow. It
would crouch down in a hollow piece of ground, in a ditch,
or at the side of a hedge, so as to hide itself, when McDonald&#8217;s
situation was like to expose him to detection. With
the assistance of one of these well trained-horses, this man,
on one occasion, saved his wife, Ann Jamieson, from prison,
and perhaps from the gallows. Ann was apprehended near
Dunfermline for some of her unlawful practices. As the
officers of the law were conducting her to prison, McDonald
rode up to the party, and requested permission to speak
with their prisoner, which was readily granted, as, from
McDonald&#8217;s appearance, the officers supposed he had something
to say to the woman. He then drew her aside, under
the pretence of conversing with her in private, when, in an
instant, Ann, with his assistance, sprang upon the horse, behind
him, and bade good-bye to the messengers, who were
amazed at the sudden and unexpected escape of their prisoner.
Ann was a little, handsome woman, and was considered
one of the most expert of the Scottish Gipsies at
conducting a plundering at a fair; and was, on that account,
much respected by her tribe.</p>

<p>McDonald and Jamieson, like others of the superior classes
of Gipsies, gave tokens of protection to their particular
friends of the community generally. The butchers of Linlithgow,
when they went to the country, with money to buy
cattle, frequently procured these assurances from the Gipsies.
The shoemakers did likewise, when they had to go to
distant markets with their shoes. Linlithgow appears even
to have been under the special protection of these banditti.
Mr. George Hart, and Mr. William Baird, two of the most
respectable merchants of Bo&#8217;ness, who had been peddlers in
their early years, scrupled not to say that, when travelling
through the country, they were seldom without tokens from
the Gipsies. But if the Gipsies were kind to those who
kept on good terms with them, they, on the other hand, vindictively
tormented their enemies. They would steal sheep,
and put the blood and parts of the animal about the premises
of those they hated, that they might be suspected of the
theft, searched and affronted by the enquiries made about
the stolen property.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>When McDonald and Jamieson attacked individuals on
the highway, or elsewhere, and were satisfied that they had
little or no money, they were just as ready to supply their
wants as to rob them. The idea of plundering the wealthy,
and giving the booty to the poor, gives the Gipsies great
satisfaction. The standard by which this people&#8217;s conduct
can be measured, must be sought for among the robber tribes
of Tartary, Afghanistan, or Arabia. Many of our Scottish
Gipsies have, indeed, been as ready to give a purse as take
one; and it cannot be said that they have lacked in the display
of a certain degree of honour peculiar to themselves,
as the following well-authenticated fact will illustrate.<a name="FNanchor90" id="FNanchor90"></a><a href="#Footnote90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>A gentleman, whose name is not mentioned, while travelling,
under night, between Falkirk and Linlithgow, fell in,
on the road, with a man whom he did not know. During
the conversation which ensued, he mentioned to the stranger
that he was afraid of being attacked, for many a one, he observed,
had been robbed on that road. He then urged that
they should return, as the safest plan for them both. The
stranger, however, replied that he had often travelled the
road, yet had never been troubled by any one. After some
further conversation, he put his hand into his pocket, and
gave the traveller a knife, with which he was desired to proceed
without fear.<a name="FNanchor91" id="FNanchor91"></a><a href="#Footnote91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> The traveller now perfectly understood
the relation that existed between them, and continued his
journey with confidence; but he had not proceeded far ere
he was accosted by a foot-pad, to whom he produced the
knife. The pad looked at it carefully, said nothing, but
passed on, without giving the traveller the slightest annoyance.
It is needless to say that the mysterious stranger was
no other than the notorious Captain McDonald. The traveller,
by his fears and the nature of his conversation, had
plainly informed McDonald of his being possessed of money&mdash;a
considerable quantity of which he had, indeed, with him&mdash;and
had the love of booty been the Gipsy&#8217;s sole and constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
object, how easily could he, in this instance, have possessed
himself of it. But the stronger had put himself, in a
measure, under the protection of the robber, who disdained
to take advantage of the confidence reposed in him.</p>

<p>Another instance of a Gipsy&#8217;s honour, generosity, or caprice,
or by whatever word the act may be expressed, occurred
between McDonald and a farmer of the name of Campbell,
and exhibits a singular cast of character, which has not been
uncommon among the Scottish Gipsies. On this occasion,
it would appear, the Gipsy had been influenced rather by a
desire of enjoying the extraordinary surprise of the simple
countryman, than of obtaining booty. The occurrence will
also give some idea of the part which the cautious chiefs take
in plundering at a fair. The particulars are derived from
a Mr. David McRitchie, of whom I shall again make mention.</p>

<p>While Campbell was on his way to a market in Perth, he
fell in with Captain McDonald. Being unacquainted with
the character of his fellow-traveller, the unsuspecting man
told him, among other things, that he had just as much money
in his pocket as would purchase one horse, for his four-horse
plough, having other three at home. McDonald heard all
this with patience till he came to a solitary part of the road,
when, all at once, he turned upon the astonished farmer, and
demanded his money. The poor man, having no alternative,
immediately produced his purse. But in parting, the robber
desired him to call next day at a certain house in Perth,
where he would find a person who might be of some service
to him. Campbell promised to do as desired, and called at
the house appointed, and great was his surprise, when, on
being ushered into a room, he found himself face to face with
the late robber, sitting with a large bowl of smoking toddy
before him. The Gipsy, in a frank and hearty manner, invited
his visitor to sit down and share his toddy with him;
a request which he readily complied with, although bewildered
with the idea of the probable fate of his purse, and
the result of his personal adventure. He had scarcely got
time, however, to swallow one glass, before he was relieved
of his suspense, by the Gipsy returning him every farthing
of the money he had robbed him of the day before. Being
now pleased with his good fortune, and the Gipsy pressing
him to drink, Campbell was in no hurry to be gone, his
spirits having become elevated with his good cheer, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
confidence with which his host&#8217;s conduct had inspired him.
But his suspicions returned upon him, as he saw pocket-book
after pocket-book brought in to his entertainer, during the
time he was enjoying his hospitality. The Gipsy chief was,
in fact, but following a very important branch of his calling,
and was, on that day, doing a considerable business, having
a number of youths ferreting for him in the market, and
coming in and going out constantly.</p>

<p>But this crafty Gipsy, and his brother-in-law, Jamieson,
were at last apprehended for house-breaking and robbery.
Their trials took place at Edinburgh, on the 9th and 13th
of August, 1770, and &#8220;the fame of being Egyptians&#8221; made
part of the charge against them in the indictment; a charge
well founded, as both of them spoke the &#8220;right Egyptian
language.&#8221; It was the last instance, I believe, that the fact
of their being &#8220;called, known, repute, and holden Egyptians,&#8221;
made part of the indictment against any of the tribe
in Scotland, under the sanguinary statute of James VI,
chap. 13, passed in 1609. So cunning are the Gipsies, however,
in committing crimes, that, in this instance, the criminals,
it was understood, would have escaped justice, for want
of sufficient proof, had not one of their own band, of the
name of Jamieson, a youth of about twenty-two years of age,
turned king&#8217;s evidence against his associates. The two unhappy
men were then found guilty by the jury, and condemned
to die. They were ordered to be executed at
Linlithgow bridge, near the very spot where their band had
their principal rendezvous, with the apparent object of daunting
their incorrigible race.</p>

<p>Immediately after the trial, a report was spread, and
generally believed, that the Gipsies would attempt a rescue
of the criminals on the way to execution, or even from under
the gallows itself; and it was particularly mentioned that
thirty stout and desperate members of the race had undertaken
to set their chieftains free. Every precaution was
therefore taken, by the authorities, to prevent any such
attempt being made. A large proportion of the gentlemen
and farmers of the shire of Linlithgow were requested,
with what arms they could procure, to attend, on foot or
horseback, the execution of the desperate Tinklers. Indeed,
every third man of all the fencible men of the county was
called upon to appear on the occasion; while a company of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
pensioners, with a commissioned officer at their head, and a
strong body of the military, completed the force deemed
necessary for the due execution of justice. Besides guarding
against the possibility of a rescue on the part of the
Gipsies, it was generally understood that the steps taken by
the authorities, in bringing together so large a body of men,
had in view the object of exhibiting to the people the ignominious
death of two men who had not only been allowed
to remain among them, but, in many instances, countenanced
by some of the most respectable inhabitants of the county;
and that not only in out-door amusements, but even in some
of the special hospitalities of daily life, while in fact they
were nothing but the leaders of a band of notorious thieves
and robbers.</p>

<p>These precautions being completed, the condemned Gipsies
were bound hand and foot, and conveyed, by the sheriff of
Edinburgh and a company of the military, to the boat-house
bridge, on the river Almond&mdash;the boundary of the two
counties&mdash;and there handed over to the sheriff of Linlithgow;
under whose guard they were carried to the jail of
the town of Linlithgow, and securely bound in irons, to wait
their execution on the morrow.<a name="FNanchor92" id="FNanchor92"></a><a href="#Footnote92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> As night approached, fires
were kindled at the door of the prison, and guards posted
in the avenues leading to the building, while all the entrances
to the town were guarded, and all ingress and egress prohibited,
as if the burgh had been in a state of siege. So
strictly were these orders put in force, that many of the inhabitants
of Bo&#8217;ness, who had gone to Linlithgow, to view
the bustle occasioned by the assemblage of so great a number
of armed men, were forced to remain in the town over
night; so alarmed were the authorities for the onset of the
resolute Gipsies. It was soon perceived, by some sagacious
individuals, that the fires would do more harm than good,
as the light would show the prison, expose the sentinels, and
guide the Gipsy bands. They were accordingly extinguished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and the guards placed in such positions as would enable
them, with the most advantage, to repel any attack that
might be attempted: yet the enemy that caused all this
alarm and precaution was nowhere visible.</p>

<p>On the following morning, McDonald&#8217;s wife requested
permission to visit her husband before being led to execution,
with what particular object can only be conjectured; a
favour which was readily granted her, in the company of a
magistrate. On beholding the object of her affection, she
became overwhelmed with grief; she threw her arms around
his neck, and embraced him most tenderly; and after giving
vent to her sorrow in sobs and tears, she tore herself from
him, and, turning to the magistrate, exclaimed, with a bursting
heart, &#8220;Is he not a pretty man? What a pity it is to
hang him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Arrangements were then made to carry the prisoners to
the place of execution, at the bridge of Linlithgow, which
lay about a mile from the town. The armed force was
drawn up at the town-cross, and those who carried muskets
were ordered to load them with ball cartridge, and hold
themselves ready, at the word of command, upon the least
appearance of an attempt at rescue, to fire upon the aggressors.
The whole scene presented such an alarming and war-like
appearance, that the people of the town and surrounding
country compared it to the bustle and military parade which
took place, twenty-five years before, when the rebel army
made its appearance in the neighbourhood. The judicious
arrangements adopted by the officers of the crown had the
desired effect; for not the slightest symptom of disturbance,
not even a movement, was observed among the Gipsies,
either on the night before, or on the morning of the execution.
The formidable armed bands, ready to overwhelm
the presumptuous Gipsies, clearly showed them that they
had not the shadow of a chance for carrying out their intended
rescue. All was peace and silence throughout the
immense crowd surrounding the gallows, patiently waiting
the appearance of the criminals. In due time the condemned
made their appearance, in a cart, accompanied by Charles
and James Jamieson, two youths, sitting beside their father
and uncle, busily eating rolls, and, to all appearance, totally
indifferent to the fate of their relatives, and the awful circumstances
surrounding them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>On ascending the platform, Jamieson&#8217;s demeanour was
suitable to the circumstances in which he found himself
placed; but McDonald appeared quite unconcerned. He
was observed frequently to turn a quid of tobacco in his
mouth, and squirt the juice of it around him; it was even
evident, from his manner, that he expected to be delivered
from the gallows by his tribe; and more especially as he
had been frequently heard to say that the hemp was not
grown that would hang him. He then began to look frequently
and wistfully around him for the expected aid, yet
none made its appearance; and his heart began to sink
within him. Indeed, the overwhelming force then surrounding
him rendered a deliverance impossible. Every hope
having failed him, and seeing his end at hand, McDonald
resigned himself, with great firmness, to his fate, and exclaimed:
&#8220;I have neither friends on my right hand nor on
my left; I see I now must die.&#8221; Jamieson, who appeared
from the first never to indulge in vain expectations of being
rescued, exclaimed to his fellow-sufferer: &#8220;Sandie, Sandie!
it is all over with us, and I told you so long ago.&#8221; McDonald
then turned to the executioner, whose name was
John Livingston, and dropping into his hand something,
supposed to be money, undauntedly said to him: &#8220;Now,
John, don&#8217;t bungle your job.&#8221; Both of the unhappy men
were then launched into eternity. Ever afterwards, the inhabitants
of Linlithgow pestered the hangman, by calling to
him: &#8220;Now, John, don&#8217;t bungle your job. What was it the
Tinkler gave you, John?&#8221;<a name="FNanchor93" id="FNanchor93"></a><a href="#Footnote93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>McDonald&#8217;s wife had stood by, a quiet spectator, among
the promiscuous crowd, of the melancholy scene displayed
before her. But when she had witnessed the closing act of
an eventful life&mdash;the heroism and fortitude which all she
held as dear displayed in his last moments&mdash;and enjoyed the
satisfaction which it had given her, nature, which the odium
of her fellow-creatures, not of her blood, could not destroy,
burst forth with genuine expression. The silence attending
the awful tragedy was abruptly broken by the lamentable
yells and heart-rending screams which she gave vent to, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
she beheld her husband turned off the scaffold. Two gentlemen,
who were present, informed me that she foamed at the
mouth, and tore her hair out of her head, and was so completely
frantic with grief and rage, that the spectators were
afraid to go near her.</p>

<p>On the bodies being taken down from the scaffold, an attempt
was made to restore them to life, by opening a vein,
but without effect. It is said they were buried in the moor
near Linlithgow, by the Gipsies, and that the magistrates of
the town ordered them to be taken up, and interred in the
east end of the church-yard of Linlithgow. However that
may be, the bodies were buried in the church-yard of Linlithgow;
but the populace, delivered from the terror with
which these daring Gipsies inspired them, treated with ignominy
the remains of those whom they dared scarcely look
in the face when alive. They dug them out of the place of
Christian sepulture, and interred them in a solitary field in
the neighbourhood. A clump of trees, I believe, marks the
spot, and the gloomy pine now waves, in the winds of heaven,
over the silent and peaceful graves of the restless and lawless
Gipsies.</p>

<p>McDonald, it would appear, was married, first of all, to a
daughter of a Gipsy of the name of Eppie Lundie, with
whom he lived unhappy, and was divorced from her over a
horse sacrificed for the occasion, a ceremony which I will
describe in another <a href="#Page_257">chapter</a>.<a name="FNanchor94" id="FNanchor94"></a><a href="#Footnote94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> He was more fortunate in
his second matrimonial alliance, for, in Ann Jamieson, he
found a wife after his own heart in every way. Previous to
his own execution, she had witnessed the violent deaths of
at least six of her own nearest relatives. But, if anything
could have influenced, in the slightest degree, a reformation
in her own character, it would have been the melancholy
scene attending his miserable end; yet, we find it had not
the slightest effect upon her after career, for she continued,
to the last, to follow the practices of her race, as an anecdote
told of her will show.</p>

<p>At the North Queensferry was a very respectable inn, kept
by a Mr. McRitchie, which was much frequented and patronized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
by the Gipsies. On such occasions they did not visit
the house in whole families or hordes, fluttering in rags, but
as well-dressed individuals, arriving from different directions,
as if by chance. In this house they were always treated
with consideration and kindness, for other reasons than that
of the liberal custom which they brought to it, and, as a
natural consequence, the landlord and his family became
great favourites with them. One of the members of the
family, David McRitchie, my informant, happened one day
to purchase a horse, at a fair in Dunfermline, but in feeling
for his pocket-book, to pay for the animal, he found, to his
surprise and grief, that book and money were gone. The
person from whom he bought the horse commenced at once
to abuse him as an impostor, for he not only would not believe
his tale, but would not trust him for a moment. Under
these distressing circumstances, he sought out Ann Jamieson,
or Annie McDonald, after her husband&#8217;s name, for he knew
well enough where his money had gone to, and the sovereign
influence which Ann exercised over her tribe. Being well
acquainted with her, from having often met her in his father&#8217;s
house, he went up to her, and putting his hand gently
on her shoulder, in a kind and familiar manner, and with a
long face, told her of his misfortune, and begged her friendly
assistance to help him out of the difficulty, laying much stress
on the horse-dealer charging him with an attempt to impose
on him. &#8220;Some o&#8217; my laddies will hae seen it, Davie; I&#8217;ll
enquire,&#8221; was her immediate reply. She then took him to a
public-house, called for brandy, saw him seated, and desired
him to drink. Taking the marks of the pocket-book, she
entered the fair, and, after various doublings and windings
among the crowd, proceeded to her temporary depot of
stolen goods. In about half an hour she returned, with the
book and all its contents. The cash, bills, and papers which
it contained, were in the same parts of the book in which the
owner had placed them. This affair was transacted in as
cool and business-like a manner as if Annie and her &#8220;laddies&#8221;
had been following any of the honest callings in ordinary
life. Indeed, no example, however severe, no punishment,
however awful, seems to have had any beneficial effect upon
the minds of these Gipsies, or their friends who frequented
the surrounding parts of the country, for they continued to
follow the ways of their race, in spite of the sanguinary laws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
of the country. A continuation of their history, up to a
period, is little better than a melancholy narrative of a series
of imprisonments, banishments, and executions.</p>

<p>Ann Jamieson&#8217;s two nephews, Charles and James Jamieson,
who rode alongside of their father and uncle to the
place of their execution, eating rolls, as if nothing unusual
was about to befall them, and who had witnessed their
miserable end, in 1770, were themselves executed in 1786
for robbing the Kinross mail. It was their intention to
have committed the deed upon the highway, for, the night
before the robbery, their mother, Euphan Graham, to prevent
detection, insisted upon the post-boy being put to death,
to which bloody proposition her sons would not consent. It
was then agreed that they should secure their prize in the
stable yard of an inn in the town, where the post-boy usually
stopped. The two highwaymen were traced to a small
house near Stirling, in which they made a desperate resistance.
One of them attempted to ascend the chimney, to
effect his escape; but, failing in that, they attacked the officers,
and tore at them with their teeth, after having struck
furiously at them with a knife. But they were overpowered,
and secured in irons. Two females were in their company
at the time, on whom some of the money was found, most
artfully concealed about their persons. So illiterate were
these two men that, in crossing the Forth at Kincardine,
they presented a twenty-pound note, to be changed, instead
of a twenty-shilling one. According to Baron Hume, the
trial of these two Gipsies took place on the 18th December,
1786. They were assisted in the robbery by other members
of their band, including women and children. Their mother
was said to have been transported for the part which she
took in the affair; while another member of the gang was
below the age at which criminals can be tried and punished
in this country. The two brothers, before they committed
the crime, measured themselves in a room in Kinross, kept
by a Mary Barclay, and marked their heights on the wall.
The one stood six feet two inches, and the other five feet
four inches.<a name="FNanchor95" id="FNanchor95"></a><a href="#Footnote95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote87" id="Footnote87"></a><a href="#FNanchor87"><span class="label">[87]</span></a> It appears that, at this period, James Wilson, town-piper, and John
Livingston, hangman, of Linlithgow, were both Gipsies. [Formerly the
Gipsies were exclusively employed in Hungary and Transylvania as hangmen
and executioners. <i>Grellmann.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p><a name="Footnote88" id="Footnote88"></a><a href="#FNanchor88"><span class="label">[88]</span></a> This trait in the character of the Scottish Gipsies is well illustrated in
the following anecdote, which appeared in Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine. It was
obtained by an individual who frequently heard the clergyman in question
relate it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The late Mr. Leek, minister of Yetholm, happened to be riding home
one evening from a visit in Northumberland, when, finding himself likely
to be benighted, for sake of a near cut, he struck into a wild, solitary track,
or drove-road, across the fells, by a place called the Staw. In one of the
derne places through which this path led him, there stood an old deserted
shepherd&#8217;s house, which, of course, was reputed to be haunted. The minister,
though little apt to be alarmed by such reports, was, however, somewhat
startled on observing, as he approached close to the cottage, a &#8216;grim
visage&#8217; staring out past a <i>window claith</i>, or sort of curtain, which had been
fastened up to supply the place of a door, and also several &#8216;dusky figures,&#8217;
skulking among the bourtree-bushes that had once sheltered the shepherd&#8217;s
garden. Without leaving him any time for speculation, however, the knight
of the curtain bolted forth upon him, and, seizing his horse by the bridle,
demanded his money. Mr. Leek, though it was now dark, at once recognised
the gruff voice, and the great, black, burly head of his next-door
neighbour, <i>Gleid Neckit Will</i>, the Gipsy chief. &#8216;Dear me, William,&#8217; said
the minister, in his usual quiet manner,&#8216;can this be you? ye&#8217;re surely no
serious wi&#8217; me? ye wadna sae far wrang your character for a good neighbour,
for the bit trifle I ha&#8217;e to gi&#8217;e, William?&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;Lord saif us, Mr. Leek!&#8217;
said Will, quitting the rein, and lifting his hat, with great respect, &#8216;Whae
wad hae thought o&#8217; meeting you out owre here away? Ye needna gripe
for ony siller to me&mdash;I wadna touch a plack o&#8217; your gear, nor a hair o&#8217; your
head, for a&#8217; the gowd o&#8217; Tividale. I ken ye&#8217;ll no do us an ill turn for this
mistak&mdash;and I&#8217;ll e&#8217;en see ye safe through the eirie Staw&mdash;it&#8217;s no reckoned a
very <i>canny bit</i>, mair ways nor ane; but I wat ye&#8217;ll no be feared for the
<i>dead</i>, and I&#8217;ll tak care o&#8217; the <i>living</i>.&#8217; Will accordingly gave his reverend
friend a safe convoy through the haunted pass, and, notwithstanding this
ugly mistake, continued ever after an inoffensive and obliging neighbour to
the minister, who, on his part, observed a prudent and inviolable secrecy
on the subject of this rencounter, during the life time of <i>Gleid Nickit Will</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>I understand this anecdote to apply to old Will Faa, mentioned in the
Border Gipsies, under <a href="#Page_236">chapter VII</a>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote89" id="Footnote89"></a><a href="#FNanchor89"><span class="label">[89]</span></a> Some of the Gipsies only put a paper cap on the head, and paper
round the feet, of their dead; leaving all the body bare, excepting that
they place upon the breast, opposite the heart, a circle made of red and
blue ribbons, in form something like the shape of the variegated cockade,
worn in the hats of newly-enlisted recruits in the army. [In England it
was customary with the Gipsies, at one time, to burn the dead, but now
they only burn the clothes, and some of the effects of the deceased.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>FIFE AND STIRLINGSHIRE GIPSIES.</h3>

<p>In this account of the Gipsies in Fife, the horde which at
one period resided at the village of Lochgellie are frequently
referred to. But it is proper to premise that this noted
band were not the only Gipsies in Fife. This populous
county contained, at one time, a great number of nomadic
Gipsies. The Falkland hills and the Falkland fairs were
greatly frequented by them;<a name="FNanchor96" id="FNanchor96"></a><a href="#Footnote96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> and, not far from St. Andrews,
some of the tribe had, within these fifty years, a small farm,
containing about twenty acres of waste land, on which they
had a small foundry, which the country people, on that account,
called &#8220;Little Carron.&#8221; As my materials for this
chapter are chiefly derived from the Lochgellie band, and
their immediate connexions in other districts not far from
Fife, their manners and customs are, on that account, brought
more under review.</p>

<p>The village of Lochgellie was, at one time, a favourite resort
of the Gipsies. The grounds in its immediate vicinity
are exactly of that character upon which they seem to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
fixed their permanent, or rather winter&#8217;s residence, in a
great many parts of Scotland. By the statistical account of
the parish of Auchterderran, Lochgellie was almost inaccessible
for nearly six months in the year. The bleak and
heathy morasses, and rushy wastes, with which the village
is surrounded, have a gloomy and melancholy aspect. The
scenery and face of the adjoining country are very similar
to those in the neighbourhood of Biggar, in Lanarkshire,
and Middleton, in Midlothian, which were also, at that time,
Gipsy stations. A little to the south of the spot where the
Linlithgow band, at one period, had their quarters, the country
becomes moory, bleak, and barren. The village of Kirk-Yetholm,
at present full of Gipsies, is also situated upon the
confines of a wild, pastoral tract, among the Cheviot hills.<a name="FNanchor97" id="FNanchor97"></a><a href="#Footnote97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
The Gipsies, in general, appear to have located themselves
upon grounds of a flattish character, between the cultivated
and uncultivated districts; having, on one side, a fertile and
populous country, and, on the other, a heathy, boggy, and
barren waste, into which they could retire in times of danger.<a name="FNanchor98" id="FNanchor98"></a><a href="#Footnote98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>In the statistical account of Auchterderran, just alluded
to, is to be found the following notice of the Lochgellie Gipsies:
&#8220;There are a few persons called <i>Tinkers</i> and <i>Horners</i>,
half resident and half itinerant, who are feared and
suspected by the community. Two of them were banished
within these six years.&#8221; This horde, at one time, consisted
of four or five families of the names of Graham, Brown,
Robertson, &amp;c. The Jamiesons and Wilsons were also often
seen at Lochgellie; but such were the numbers that were
coming and going about the village, that it was difficult to
say who were residenters, and who were not. Some of
them had fens from the proprietor of the estate of Lochgellie.
They were dreaded for their depredations, and
were well known to the country people, all over the shires
of Fife, Kinross, Perth, Forfar, Kincardine and Aberdeen,
by the name of the &#8220;Lochgellie band.&#8221; The chiefs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
this band were the Grahams, at the head of which was old
Charles Graham, an uncommonly stout and fine-looking man.
He was banished the kingdom for his many crimes. Charlie
had been often in courts of justice, and on one occasion,
when he appeared for some crime or other, the judge, in a
surly manner, demanded of him, what had brought him
there?&mdash;&#8220;The auld thing again, my lord, but nae proof,&#8221;
was the Tinkler&#8217;s immediate reply. Ann Brown, one of his
wives, and the chief female of the band, was also sentenced to
banishment for fourteen years; seven of which, however, she
spent in the prison of Aberdeen. She remained altogether
nine years at Botany Bay, married a Gipsy abroad, returned
to Scotland, with more than a hundred pounds in cash, and
now sells earthenware at St. Andrews.<a name="FNanchor99" id="FNanchor99"></a><a href="#Footnote99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Being asked why
she left Botany Bay, while making so much money there,
she said, &#8220;It was to let them see I could come back again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Young Charlie Graham, son and successor, as chief, to old
Charlie, was hanged at Perth, about thirty years ago, for
horse-stealing. The anecdotes which are told of this singular
man are numerous. When he was apprehended, a number
of people assembled to look at him, as an object of wonder;
it being considered a thing almost impossible to take
him. His dog had discovered to the messengers the place
of his concealment, having barked at them as they came
near the spot. His feelings became irritated at the curiosity
of the people, and he called out in great bitterness to
the officers: &#8220;Let me free, and gie me a stick three feet
lang, and I&#8217;ll clear the knowe o&#8217; them.&#8221; His feet and hands
were so handsome and small, in proportion to the other
parts of his athletic body, that neither irons nor hand-cuffs
could be kept on his ankles or wrists; without injury to his
person the gyves and manacles always slipped over his
joints. He had a prepossessing countenance, an elegant
figure, and much generosity of heart; and, notwithstanding
all his tricks, was an extraordinary favourite with the public.
Among the many tricks he played, it is related that he
once, unobserved, in a grass park, converted a young colt
into a gelding. He allowed the animal to remain for some
time in the possession of the owner, and then stole it. He was
immediately detected, and apprehended; but as the owner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
swore positively to the description of his horse, and Charlie&#8217;s
being a gelding, he got off clear. The man was amazed
when he discovered the trick that had been played upon
him, but when, where, and by whom done, he was entirely
ignorant. Graham sold the animal to a third person, again
stole it, and replaced it in the park of the original owner.
He seemed to take great delight in stealing in this ingenious
manner, trying how dexterously he could carry off the
property of the astonished natives. He sometimes stole
from wealthy individuals, and gave the booty to the indigent,
although they were not Gipsies; and so accustomed
were the people, in some places, to his bloodless robberies,
that some only put their spurs to their horses, calling out, as
they passed him: &#8220;Ah ha, Charlie lad, ye hae missed your
mark to-night!&#8221; A widow, with a large family, at whose
house he had frequently been quartered, was in great distress
for want of money to pay her rent. Graham lent her
the amount required; but as the factor was returning home
with it in his pocket, Charlie robbed him, and, without loss
of time, returned to the woman, and gave her a full discharge
for the sum she had just borrowed from him.</p>

<p>He was asked, immediately before his execution, if he had
ever performed any good action during his life, to recommend
him to the mercy of his offended God. That of giving
the widow and fatherless the money of which he immediately
afterwards robbed the factor, was the only instance he adduced
in his favour; thinking that thereby he had performed
a virtuous deed. In the morning of the day on which he
was to suffer, he sent a messenger to one of the magistrates,
requesting a razor to take off his beard; at the same time,
in a calm manner, desiring the person to tell the magistrate
that, &#8220;unless his beard was shaven, he could appear before
neither God nor man.&#8221; A short time before he was taken
out to the gallows, he was observed reclining very pensively
and thoughtfully on a seat. All at once he started up, exclaiming,
in a mournful tone of voice, &#8220;Oh, can ony o&#8217; ye
read, sirs; will some o&#8217; ye read a psalm to me?&#8221; at the
same time regretting much that he had not been taught to
read. The fifty-first psalm was accordingly read to him, by
a gentleman present, which soothed his feelings exceedingly,
and gave him much ease and comfort. He was greatly
agitated after ascending the platform&mdash;his knees knocking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
against each other; but just before he was cast off, his inveterate
Gipsy feelings returned upon him with redoubled
violence. He kicked from his feet both of his shoes, in
sight of the spectators&mdash;to set at nought, as was supposed,
some prophecy that he would die with them on; and addressed
the assembled crowd in the following words: &#8220;I
am this day to be married to the gallows-tree, by suffering
in the manner of many of my ancestors; and I am extremely
glad to see such a number of respectable people at my wedding.&#8221;
A number of the band attended his execution, and,
when his body was returned to them, they all kissed it with
great affection, and held the usual lyke-wake over it. His
sweetheart, or widow, I am uncertain which, of the name
of Wilson, his own cousin, put his corpse into hot lime, then
buried it, and sat on his grave, in a state of intoxication,
till it was rendered unfit for the use of the medical gentlemen;
it having been reported that he was to be taken out
of his grave for the purpose of dissection. This man
boasted greatly, while under sentence of death, of never
having spilled human blood by committing murder.</p>

<p>Hugh Graham, brother to Charlie, above-mentioned, was
stabbed with a knife by his own cousin, John Young, in
Aberdeenshire. These powerful Gipsies never fell in with
each other but a wrestling bout took place. Young generally
came off victorious, but Graham, although worsted,
would neither quit Young nor acknowledge his inferiority
of strength. Young frequently desired Graham to keep
out of his way, as his obstinate disposition would prove
fatal to one of them some time or other. They, however,
met again, when a desperate struggle ensued. Graham was
the aggressor; he drew his knife to stab Young, who
wrested it out of his hand, and stabbing him in the upper
part of the stomach, close to the breast, laid his opponent
dead at his feet.<a name="FNanchor100" id="FNanchor100"></a><a href="#Footnote100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> In this battle the Gipsy females, in
their usual manner, took a conspicuous part, by assisting the
combatants on either side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>Jenny Graham, sister of these Grahams, was kept by a
gentleman as his mistress; but, although treated with affection,
such was her attachment to her old wandering way of
life, that she left her protector and his wealth, and rejoined
her erratic associates in the gang. She was a remarkably
handsome and good-looking woman, and, while she traversed
the country, she frequently rode upon an ass, which was
saddled and bridled. On these occasions, she was sometimes
dressed in a blue riding-habit and a black beaver hat. It
was generally supposed that the stolen articles of value belonging
to the family were committed to the care of Jenny.
Margaret Graham, another sister, is still living, and is a
woman of uncommon bodily strength; so much so, that she
is considered to be a good deal stronger than the generality
of men. She was married to William Davidson, a Gipsy,
at Wemyss. They have a large family, and sell earthenware
through the country.</p>

<p>John Young, who stabbed his cousin, Hugh Graham, was
one of seven sons, and though above five feet ten inches in
height, his mother used to call him &#8220;the dwarf o&#8217; a&#8217; my
bairns.&#8221; He was condemned and hanged at Aberdeen for
the murder. He wrote a good hand, and the country-people
were far from being displeased with his society, while
he was employed in repairing their pots and pans in the way
of his calling. Sarah Graham, his mother, was of the highest
Tinkler mettle. She lost a forefinger in a Gipsy fray.
Peter Young, another son of Sarah&#8217;s, was also hanged at
Edinburgh, after breaking a number of prisons in which he
was confined. He is spoken of as a singular man. Such
was his generosity of character, that he always exerted himself
to the utmost to set his fellow-prisoners free, although
they happened not to be in the same apartment of the
prison. The life of this man was published about the time
of his execution. When any one asked old John Young
where his sons were, his reply was, &#8220;They are all hanged.&#8221;
They were seven in number, and it was certainly a fearful
end of a whole family. The following is an extract of a
letter addressed to Mr. Blackwood, from Aberdeen, relative
to Peter Young: &#8220;It is said, in your far-famed magazine,
that Peter Young, brother to John Young, the Gipsy, likewise
suffered at <i>Aberdeen</i>. It is true that he received sentence
to die there, but the prison and all the irons the persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
were able to load him with, somehow or other, were
found insufficient to prevent him from making his escape.
After he had repeatedly broken loose, and had been as often
retaken, the magistrates at last resolved that he should be
effectually secured; and, for that purpose, ordered a great
iron chain to be provided, and Peter to be fast bound in
it. As the jailer was making everything, as he thought,
most secure, Peter, with a sigh, gazed on him, and said,
&#8216;Ay, ay, I winna come out now till I come out at the
door;&#8217; making him believe that he would not be able to
make his escape again, nor come out till the day fixed for
his execution. But the great iron chain, bolts and bars,
were all alike unable to withstand his skill and strength:
he came out, within a few nights, at the &#8216;door,&#8217; along with
such of his fellow-prisoners as were inclined to avail
themselves of the &#8216;catch;&#8217; but he was afterwards taken, and
conveyed to Edinburgh, and there made to suffer the penalty
which his crimes deserved.&mdash;D. C.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor101" id="FNanchor101"></a><a href="#Footnote101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>Charles Brown, one of the principal members of the
Lochgellie band, was killed in a desperate fight at Raploch,
near Stirling. A number of Gipsy boys, belonging to
several gangs in the south, obtained a considerable quantity
of plunder, at a fair in Perth, and had, in the
division of the spoil, somehow or another, imposed on the
Lochgellie tribe, and their associates. Charles Graham, already
mentioned, and Charles Brown, went south in pursuit
of the young depredators, for the purpose of compelling them
to give up their ill-gotten booty to those to whom, by the
Gipsy regulations, it of right belonged. After an arduous
chase, the boys were overtaken near Stirling, when a furious
battle immediately commenced. Both parties were
armed with bludgeons. After having fought for a considerable
time, with equal success on both sides, Graham, from
some unknown cause, fled, leaving his near relation, Brown,
to contend alone with the youths, in the best way he could.
The boys now became the assailants, and began to press hard
upon Brown, who defended himself long and manfully with
his bludgeon, displaying much art in the use of his weapon,
in warding off the lighter blows of his opponents, which
came in upon him from all quarters. At length he was
forced to give way, although very few of the blows reached
his person. On retreating, with his front to his assailants,
his foot struck upon an old feal dyke, when he fell to the
ground. The enraged youths now sprang in upon him, like
tigers, and, without showing him the least mercy, dispatched
him on the spot, by literally beating out his brains with
their bludgeons. Brown&#8217;s coat was brought home to Lochgellie,
by some of his wife&#8217;s friends, with the collar and
shoulders besmeared all over with blood and brains, with
quantities of his hair sticking in the gore. It was preserved
for some time in this shocking condition by his wife, and exhibited
as a proof that her husband had not fled, as well as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
arouse the clan to vengeance. My informant, a man about
fifty years of age, with others, saw this dreadful relique of
Brown, in the very state in which it is now described.</p>

<p>Alexander Brown, another member of the Lochgellie band,
happened, on one occasion, to be in need of butcher meat, for
his tribe. He had observed, grazing in a field, in the county
of Linlithgow, a bullock that had, by some accident, lost about
three-fourths of its tail. He procured a tail of a skin of the
same colour as that of the animal, and, in an ingenious manner,
made it fast to the remaining part of its tail. Disguised
in this way, he drove off his booty; but after shipping the
beast at the Queens-ferry, on his way to the north, a servant,
who had been dispatched in quest of the depredator,
overtook him as he was stepping into the boat. An altercation
immediately commenced about the ox. The countryman
said he could swear to the identity of the animal in
Brown&#8217;s possession, were it not for its long tail; and was
proceeding to examine it narrowly, to satisfy himself on that
particular, when the ready-witted Gipsy, ever fertile in expedients
to extricate himself from difficulties, took his knife
out of his pocket, and, in view of all present, cut off the tail
above the juncture, drawing blood instantly; and, throwing
it into the sea, called out to the pursuer, with some warmth:
&#8220;Swear to the ox now, and be &mdash;&mdash; to ye.&#8221; The countryman
said not another word, but returned home, while the
Tinkler proceeded on his journey with his prize.<a name="FNanchor102" id="FNanchor102"></a><a href="#Footnote102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>But this Gipsy was not always so fortunate as he was on
this occasion. Being once apprehended near Dumblane, it was
the intention of the messengers to carry him direct to Perth,
but they were under the necessity of lodging him in the
nearest prison for the night. Brown was no sooner in custody
than he began to meditate his escape. He requested,
as a favour, that the officers would sit up all night with him,
in a public-house, instead of a prison, promising them as
much meat and drink, for their indulgence and trouble, as
they should desire. His request having been granted, four
or five officers were placed in and about the room in which
he was confined, as a guard on his person, being aware of
the desperate character they had to deal with. He took
care to ply them well with the bottle; and early next morning,
before setting out, he desired one of them to put up the
window a little, to cool the apartment. After walking
several times across the room, the Gipsy, all at once, threw
himself out of the window, which was a considerable height
from the ground. The hue and cry was at his heels in an
instant; and as some of the messengers were gaining on
him, he boldly faced about, drew forth, from below his coat,
a dagger, which he brandished in the air, and threatened
death to the first who should approach him. He was, on
this occasion, suffered to make his escape, as none had the
courage to advance upon him.</p>

<p>When in full dress, Brown wore a hat richly ornamented
and trimmed with beautiful gold lace, which was then fashionable
among the first ranks in Scotland, particularly
among the officers of the army. His coat was made of
superfine cloth, of a light green colour, long in the tails, and
having one row of buttons at the breast. His shirt, of the
finest quality, was ruffled at hands and breast, with a black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
stock and buckle round the neck. He also wore a pair of handsome
boots, with silver-plated spurs, all in the fashion
of the day. Below his garments he carried a large knife,
and in the shaft or butt-end of his large whip, a small spear,
or dagger, was concealed. His brother-in-law, Wilson, was
frequently dressed in a similar garb, and both rode the best
horses in the country. Having the appearance of gentlemen
in their habits, and assuming the manners of such, which
they imitated to a wonderful degree, few persons took these
men for Gipsies. Like many of their race, they are represented
as having been very handsome, tall, and stout-made
men, with agreeable and manly countenances. Among the
numerous thefts and robberies which they committed in
their day, they were never known to have taken a sixpence
from people of an inferior class, but, on the contrary, rather
to have assisted the poor classes in their pecuniary matters,
with a generous liberality, not at all to be looked for from
men of their singular habits and manner of life. The following
particulars are descriptive of the manner and style
in which some of the Gipsies of rank, at one time, traversed
this country.</p>

<p>Within these forty-five years, Mr. McRitchie, already
alluded to, happened to be in a smithy, in the neighbourhood
of Carlisle, getting the shoes of his riding-horse roughened
on a frosty day, to enable him to proceed on his journey,
when a gentleman called for a like purpose. The animal
on which he was mounted was a handsome blood-horse, which
was saddled and bridled in a superior manner. He was himself
dressed in superfine clothes, with a riding-whip in his hand;
was booted and spurred, with saddle-bags behind him; and
had, altogether, man and horse, the equipment and appearance
of a smart English mercantile traveller, riding in the
way of his business. There being several horses in the
smithy, he, in a haughty and consequential manner, enquired
of the smith, very particularly, whose turn it was first: indicating
a strong desire to be first served, although he was
the last that had entered the smithy. This bold assurance
made my acquaintance take a steady look at the intrusive
stranger, whom he surveyed from head to foot. And what
was his astonishment when he found the mighty gentleman
to be no other than Sandie Brown, the Tinkler&#8217;s son, from
the neighbourhood of Crieff; whom he had often seen strolling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
through the country in a troop of Gipsies, and frequently
in his father&#8217;s house, at the North Queensferry. He could
scarcely believe his eyes, so to prevent any disagreeable
mistake, politely asked the &#8220;gentleman&#8221; if his name was not
Brown; observing that he thought he had seen him somewhere
before. The surprised Tinkler hesitated considerably
at the unexpected question, and, after having put some
queries on his part, answered that &#8220;he would not deny
himself&mdash;his name was really Brown.&#8221; He had, in all likelihood,
been travelling under a borrowed name, a practice
very common with the Gipsies. When he found himself
detected, yet seeing no danger to be apprehended from the
accidental meeting, he very shrewdly showed great marks
of kindness to his acquaintance. Being now quite free from
embarrassment, he, in a short time, began to display, as is
the Gipsy custom, extraordinary feats of bodily strength,
by twisting with his hands strong pieces of iron; taking
bets regarding his power in these practices, with those who
would wager with him. Before parting with my friend,
Brown very kindly insisted upon treating him with a bottle
of any kind of liquor he would choose to drink. At some
sequestered station of his tribe, on his way home, the equestrian
Tinkler would unmask himself&mdash;dispose of his horse,
pack up his fine clothes, and assume his ragged coat, leathern
apron, and budget&mdash;before he would venture among the
people of the country, who were acquainted with his real
character. Here we see a haughty, overbearing, highway
robber, clothed in excellent apparel, and mounted on a good
steed, metamorphose himself, in an instant, into a poor,
wandering, beggarly, and pitiful Gipsy.</p>

<p>This Alexander Brown, and his brother-in-law, Wilson,
carried on conjointly a considerable trade in horse-stealing
between Scotland and England. The horses which were
stolen in the South were brought to Scotland, and sold there;
those stolen in Scotland were, on the other hand, disposed
of in the South by English Gipsies. The crime of horse-stealing
has brought a great many of these wanderers to an
untimely end on the gallows. Brown was at last hanged at
Edinburgh, to expiate the many crimes he had, from time
to time, committed. It is said that his brother-in-law, Wilson,
was hanged along with him on the same day, having
been also guilty of a number of crimes. Brown was taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
in a wood in Rannach, having been surprised and overpowered
by a party of Highlanders, raised for the purpose of
apprehending him, and dispersing his band, who lay in the
wood in which he was captured. He thought to evade them
by clapping close to the ground, like a wild animal. Upon
being seized, a furious scuffle ensued; and during the violent
tossing and struggling which took place, while they
were securing this sturdy wanderer, he took hold of the
bare thigh of one of the Highlanders, and bit it most cruelly.
Martha, the mother of Brown, and the mother-in-law
of Wilson, was apprehended in the act of stealing a pair of
sheets while attending their execution.</p>

<p>Charles, by some called William, a brother of Alexander
Brown, was run down by a party of the military and some
messengers, near Dundee. He was carried to Perth, where
he was tried, condemned and executed, to atone for the numerous
crimes of which he was guilty. He was conveyed
to Perth by water, in consequence of it being reported that
the Gipsies of Fife, with the Grahams and Ogilvies at their
head, were in motion to rescue him. He, also, was a man
of great personal strength; and regretting, after being
handcuffed, having allowed himself to be so easily taken, he,
in wrath, drove the messengers before him with his feet, as
if they had been children. While in the apartment of the
prison called the condemned cell, or the cage, he freed himself
from his irons, and by some means set on fire the damp
straw on which he lay, with the design of making his escape
in the confusion. Surprised at the building being on fire,
and suspecting Brown to have been the cause of it, and that
he was free from his chains, ramping like a lion in his den,
no one, in the hurry, could be found with resolution enough
to venture near him, till a sergeant of the forty-second regiment
volunteered his services. Before he would face the
Tinkler, however, he requested authority from the magistrates
to defend himself with his broad-sword, and, in case
the prisoner became desperate, to cut him down. This permission
being obtained, the sergeant drew his sword, and,
assisted by the jailer&#8217;s daughter, unbarred the doors, till he
came to the cage, whence the prison was being filled with
smoke. As he advanced to the door, he asked with a loud
voice, &#8220;Who is there?&#8221; &#8220;The devil,&#8221; vociferated the Gipsy,
through fire and smoke. &#8220;I am also a devil, and of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
black-watch,&#8221; thundered back the intrepid Highlander. The
resolute reply of the soldier sounded like a death knell to
the artful Tinkler&mdash;he knew his man&mdash;it daunted him completely;
for, after some threats from the sergeant, he quietly
allowed himself to be again loaded with irons, and
thoroughly secured in his cell, whence he did not stir till the
day of his execution.</p>

<p>Lizzy Brown, by some called Snippy, a member of the
same family, was a tall, stout woman, with features far from
being disagreeable. She lost her nose in a battle, fought in
the shire of Angus. In this rencounter, the Gipsies fought
among themselves with highland dirks, exhibiting all the
fury of hostile tribes of Bedouin Arabs of the desert. When
this woman found that her nose was struck off, by the sweep
of a dirk, she put her hand to the wound, and, as if little
had befallen her, called out, in the heat of the scuffle, to
those nearest her: &#8220;But, in the middle o&#8217; the meantime,
where is my nose?&#8221; Poor Lizzy&#8217;s tall figure was conspicuous
among the tribe, owing to the want of that ornamental
part of her face.</p>

<p>The Grahams of Lochgellie, the Wilsons of Raploch, near
Stirling, and the Jamiesons, noticed under the head of Linlithgowshire
Gipsies, were all, by the female side, immediately
descended from old Charles Stewart, a Gipsy chief, at
one period of no small consequence, among these hordes.<a name="FNanchor103" id="FNanchor103"></a><a href="#Footnote103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
When I enquired if the Robertsons, who lived, at one time,
at Menstry, were related to the Lochgellie band, the answer
which I received was: &#8220;The Tinklers are a&#8217; sib&#8221;&mdash;meaning
that they are all connected with one another by the ties of
blood, and considered as one family. This is a most powerful
bond of union among these desperate clans, which almost
bids defiance to the breaking up of their strongly cemented
society. Old Charles Stewart was described to
me as a stout, good-looking man, with a fair complexion;
and I was informed that he lived to a great age. He affirmed,
wherever he went, that he was a descendant of the
royal Stewarts of Scotland. His descendants still assert
that they are sprung from the royal race of Scotland. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
support of this pretension, Stewart, in the year 1774, at a
wedding, in the parish of Corstorphine, actually wore a large
cocked hat, decorated with a beautiful plume of white feathers,
in imitation of the white cockade of the Pretender.
On this occasion, he wore a short coat, philabeg and purse,
and tartan hose. He sometimes wore a piece of brass, as a
star, on his left breast, with a cudgel in his hand. Such
ridiculous attire corresponds exactly with the taste and
ideas of a Gipsy.<a name="FNanchor104" id="FNanchor104"></a><a href="#Footnote104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> These pretensions of Stewart are exactly
of a piece with the usual Gipsy policy of making
the people believe that they are descended from families
of rank and influence in the country. At the same time, it
cannot be denied that some of our Scottish kings, especially
James V, the &#8220;Gaberlunzie-man,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor105" id="FNanchor105"></a><a href="#Footnote105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> were far from being scrupulous
or fastidious in their vague amours. As old Charles
Stewart was, on one occasion, crossing the Forth, at Queensferry,
chained to his son-in-law, Wilson, in charge of messengers,
he, with considerable shame in his countenance, observed
David McRitchie, whose father, as already mentioned,
kept a first-rate inn at the north-side, and in which the
Tinkler had frequently regaled himself with his merry companions.
Stewart called McRitchie to him, and, taking five
shillings out of his pocket, said to him, &#8220;Hae, Davie, there&#8217;s
five shillings to drink my health, man; I&#8217;ll laugh at them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
a&#8217;.&#8221; He did laugh at them all, for nothing could be proved
against him and he was immediately set at liberty. It was,
as Charles Graham said&mdash;&#8220;The auld thing again, but nae
proof.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor106" id="FNanchor106"></a><a href="#Footnote106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Another very singular Gipsy, of the name of Jamie Robertson,
a near relation of the Lochgellie tribe, resided at
Menstry, at the foot of the Ochil hills. James was an excellent
musician, and was in great request at fairs and country
weddings. Although characterized by a dissoluteness
of manners, and professed roguery, this man, when trusted,
was strictly honest. A decent man in the neighbourhood,
of the name of Robert Gray, many a time lent him sums of
money, to purchase large ox horns and other articles, in the
east of Fife, which he always repaid on the very day he
promised, with the greatest correctness and civility. The
following anecdote will show the zeal with which he would
resent an insult which he conceived to be offered to his
friend: In one of his excursions through Fife, he happened
to be lying on the ground, basking himself in the sun, while
baiting his ass, on the roadside, when a countryman, an
entire stranger to him, came past, singing, in lightness of
heart, the song of &#8220;Auld Robin Gray,&#8221; which, unfortunately
for the man, Robertson had never heard before. On the
unconscious stranger coming to the words &#8220;Auld Robin
Gray was a kind man to me,&#8221; the hot-blooded Gipsy started
to his feet, and, with a volley of oaths, felled him with his
bludgeon to the ground; repeating his blows in the most
violent manner, and telling him, &#8220;Auld Robin Gray was a
kind man to him indeed, but it was not for him to make a
song on Robin for that.&#8221; In short, he nearly put the innocent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
man to death, in the heat of his passion, for satirizing,
as he thought, his friend in a scurrilous song. It was an invariable
custom with Robertson, whenever he passed Robert
Gray&#8217;s house, even were it at the dead hour of night, to
draw out his &#8220;bread winner,&#8221; and give him a few of his
best airs, in gratitude for his kindness.</p>

<p>Robertson&#8217;s wife, a daughter of Martha, whose son and
son-in-law, Brown and Wilson, were executed, as already
mentioned, was sentenced to transportation to Botany Bay;
but, owing to her advanced years, it was not thought worth
the expense and trouble of sending her over seas, and she
was set at liberty. Her grandson, Joyce Robertson, would
also have been transported, if not hanged, but for the assistance
of some of his clan rescuing him from Stirling jail.
So coolly and deliberately did he go about his operations, in
breaking out of the prison, that he took along with him his
oatmeal bag, and a favourite bird, in a cage, with which he
had amused himself during his solitary confinement. The
following anecdote of this audacious Gipsy, which was told
to me by an inhabitant of Stirling, who was well acquainted
with the parties, is, I believe, unequalled in the history of
robberies: While Robertson was lying in jail, an old man,
for what purpose is not mentioned, went to the prison window,
to speak to him through the iron stauncheons. Joyce,
putting forth his hand, took hold of the unsuspecting man
by the breast of his coat, and drew him close up to the iron
bars of the window; then thrusting out his other hand, and
pointing a glittering knife at his heart, threatened him with
instant death, if he did not deliver him the money he had on
him. The poor man, completely intimidated, handed into
the prison all the money he had; but had it returned, on
the jailer being informed of the extraordinary transaction.<a name="FNanchor107" id="FNanchor107"></a><a href="#Footnote107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
After escaping from confinement, this Gipsy stole a watch
from a house at Alva, but had hardly got it into his possession
before he was discovered, and had the inhabitants of
the village in pursuit of him. A man, of the name of Dawson,
met him in his flight, and, astonished at seeing the crowd
at his heels, enquired, impatiently, what was the matter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
&#8220;They are all running after me, and you will soon run too,&#8221;
replied the Tinkler, without shortening his step. He took
to Tullibody plantations, but was apprehended, and had the
watch taken from him.</p>

<p>I will notice another principal Gipsy, closely connected
by blood with the Fife bands, and of that rank that entitled
him to issue tokens to the members of his tribe. The name
of this chief was Charles Wilson, and his place of residence,
at one time, was Raploch, close by Stirling castle, where he
possessed some heritable property in houses. He was a
stout, athletic, good-looking man, fully six feet in stature,
and of a fair complexion; and was, in general, handsomely
dressed, frequently displaying a gold watch, with many seals
attached to its chain. In his appearance he was respectable,
very polite in his manners, and had, altogether, little or
nothing about him which, at first sight, or to the general
public, indicated him to be a Gipsy. But, nevertheless, I
was assured by one of the tribe, who was well acquainted
with him, that he spoke the language, and observed all the
customs, and followed the practices of the Gipsies.</p>

<p>He was a pretty extensive horse-dealer, having at times
in his possession numbers of the best bred horses in the
country. He most commonly bought and sold hunters, and
such as were suitable for cavalry; and for some of his horses
he received upwards of a hundred guineas apiece. In his
dealings he always paid cash for his purchases, but accepted
bills from his customers of respectability. Many a one purchased
horses of him; and he was taken notice of by many
respectable people in the neighbourhood; but the community
in general looked upon him, and his people, with suspicion
and fear, and were by no means fond of quarrelling with
any of his vindictive fraternity. When any of his customers
required a horse from him, and told him that the matter was
left wholly to himself, as regards price, but to provide an
animal suitable for the purpose required, no man in Scotland
would act with greater honour than Charles Wilson. He
would then fit his employer completely, and charge for the
horse exactly what the price should be. To this manner of
dealing he was very averse, and endeavoured to avoid it as
much as possible. It is said he was never known to deceive
any one in his transactions, when entire confidence was
placed in him. But, on the other hand, when any tried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
make a bargain with him, without any reference to himself,
but trusting wholly to their own judgment, he would take
three prices for his horses, if he could obtain them, and
cheat them, if it was in his power. It is said his people
stole horses in Ireland, and sent them to him, to dispose of
in Scotland. On one occasion his gang stole and sold in
Edinburgh, Stirling and Dumbarton a grey stallion, three
different times in one week. Wilson himself was almost
always mounted on a blood-horse of the highest mettle.</p>

<p>At one time, Charles Wilson travelled the country with a
horse and cart, vending articles which his gang plundered
from shops in Glasgow and other places. He had an associate
who kept a regular shop, and when Wilson happened
to be questioned about his merchandise, he always had fictitious
bills of particulars, invoices and receipts, ready to
show that the goods were lawfully purchased from his merchant,
who was no other than his friend and associate. As
Charles was chief of his tribe, he received the title of captain,
to distinguish him from the meaner sort of his race.
Like others of his rank among the Gipsies, he generally had
a numerous gang of youths in fairs, plundering for him in all
directions, among the heedless and unthinking crowd. But
he always managed matters with such art and address that,
however much he might be suspected, no evidence could
ever be found to show that he acted a part in such transactions.
It was well understood, however, that Charlie, as
he was commonly called, divided the contents of many a
purse with his band; all the plundered articles being in
fact brought to him for distribution.</p>

<p>This chief, as I have already mentioned, issued tokens to
the members of his own tribe; a part of the polity of the
Gipsies which will be fully described in the <a href="#Page_185">following chapter</a>.
But, besides these regular Gipsy tokens, he, like many
of his nation, gave tokens of protection to his particular
friends of the community at large. The following is one
instance, among many, of this curious practice among the
Gipsies. I received the particulars from the individual
himself who obtained the token or passport from Wilson.
My informant, Mr. Buchanan, a retired officer of the Excise,
chanced, in his youth, to be in a fair at Skirling, in Peebles-shire,
when an acquaintance of his, of the name of John
Smith, of Carnwath Mill, received, in a tent, fifty pounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
for horses which he had sold in the market. Wilson, who
was acquainted with both parties, was in the tent at the
time, and saw the latter receive the money. On leaving the
tent, Smith mentioned to his friend that he was afraid of
being robbed in going home, as Wilson knew he had money
in his possession. Mr. Buchanan, being well acquainted
with Wilson, went to him in the fair, and told him the plain
facts; that Smith and himself were to travel with money on
their persons, and that they were apprehensive of being
robbed of it, on their way home. The Gipsy, after hesitating
for a moment, gave Buchanan a pen-knife, which he
was to show to the first person who should offer to molest
them; at the same time enjoining him to keep the affair
quite private. After my informant and his friend had
travelled a considerable distance on their way home, they
observed, at a little distance before them, a number of
Tinklers&mdash;men and women&mdash;fighting together on the side
of the road. One of the females came forward to the
travellers, and urged them vehemently to assist her husband,
who, she said, was like to be murdered by others who had
fallen upon him on the highway. My friend knew quite
well that all the fighting was a farce, got up for the purpose
of robbing him and his companion, the moment they interfered
with the combatants in their feigned quarrel. Instead
of giving the woman the assistance she asked, he privately
and very quietly, as if he wished nobody to see it, showed
her Wilson&#8217;s knife in his hand, when she immediately exclaimed,
&#8220;You are our friends,&#8221; and called, at the same
moment, to those engaged in the scuffle, in words to the
same effect. Both the travellers now passed on, but, on
looking behind them, they observed that the squabble had
entirely ceased. The pen-knife was returned to Wilson the
day following.</p>

<p>I may give, in this place, another instance of these tokens
being granted by the Gipsies to their particular favourites
of the community. The particulars were given to me by
the individual with whom the incident occurred; and the
Gipsy mentioned I have myself seen and spoken to: A&mdash;&mdash;
A&mdash;&mdash;, a small farmer, who resided in the west of Fife,
happened to be at one of the Falkland fairs, where, in the
evening, he fell in with old Andrew Steedman, a Gipsy horse-dealer
from Lochgellie, with whom he was well acquainted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
They entered a public-house in Falkland to have a dram together,
before leaving the fair, and after some conversation
had passed, on various subjects, Steedman observed to his
acquaintance that it would be late in the night before he
could reach his home, and that he might be exposed to some
danger on the road; but he would give him his snuff-box,
to present and offer a snuff to the first person who should
offer to molest him. My informant, possessed of the Gipsy&#8217;s
snuff-box, mounted his horse, and left his acquaintance and
Falkland behind for his home. He had not proceeded far
on his journey, before a man in the dark seized the bridle
of his horse, and ordered him to stop; without, however,
enforcing his command to surrender in that determined tone
and manner common to highwaymen with those they intend
to rob. The farmer at once recognized the robber to be no
other than young Charles Graham, one of the Lochgellie
Tinklers, whom he personally knew. Instead of delivering
him his purse, he held out to him the snuff-box, as if nothing
had happened, and, offering him a pinch, asked him if he was
going to Lochgellie to-night. A sort of parley now ensued,
the farmer feeling confident in the strength of his protection,
and Graham confounded at being recognized by an acquaintance
whom he was about to rob, and who, moreover,
was in possession of a Gipsy token. At first a dry conversation
ensued, similar to that between persons unacquainted
with each other when they happen to meet; but Graham,
recovering his self-possession, soon became very frank and
kind, and insisted on the farmer accompanying him to a
public-house on the road-side, where he would treat him to
a dram. The farmer, a stout, athletic man, and no coward,
complied with the Gipsy&#8217;s invitation without hesitation.
While drinking their liquor, Graham took up the snuff-box,
and examined it all over very attentively, by the light of
the candle, and returned it, without making a single remark,
relative either to the untoward occurrence or the snuff-box
itself. The farmer was equally silent as to what had taken
place; but he could not help noticing the particular manner
in which the Gipsy examined the token. They drank a
hearty dram together, and parted the best of friends; the
farmer for his home, and Graham, as he supposed, for the
highway, to exercise his calling. Graham, about this period,
resided in a house belonging to Steedman, in Lochgellie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>Instances occurred of individuals, who happened to be
plundered, applying to Charles Wilson for his assistance to
recover their property. The particulars of the following
case are in the words of a friend who gave me the anecdote:
&#8220;A boy, having received his hard-earned fee, at the
end of a term, set out for Stirling to purchase some clothes
for himself. On the road he was accosted by two men, who
conversed with and accompanied him to Stirling. The lad
proceeded accordingly to fit himself in a shop with a new
suit, but, to his utter disappointment and grief, his small
penny-fee was gone. The merchant questioned him about
the road he had come, and whether he had been in company
with any one on the way or otherwise. Upon the appearance
of his companions being described, the shop-keeper
suspected they might have picked his pocket unobserved.
As a last resource, the boy was advised to call upon Charlie
Wilson, and relate to him the particulars of his misfortune;
which he accordingly did. Charles heard his story to the
end, and desired him to call next day, when he might be
able to give him some information relative to his loss. The
young lad kept the appointment, and, to his great joy, the
Tinkler chief paid him down every farthing of his lost
money; but at the same time told him to ask no questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>This Gipsy chief died within these thirty-five years in his own
house, on the castle-hill at Stirling, whither he had removed
from Raploch. It is stated that, for a considerable time before
his death, he relinquished his former practices, and died
in full communion with the church.<a name="FNanchor108" id="FNanchor108"></a><a href="#Footnote108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> He was, about the
latter end of his life, reduced to considerable poverty, and
was under the necessity of betaking himself to his original
occupation of making horn spoons for a subsistence. In
the days of his prosperity, Charles was considered a very
kind-hearted and generous man to the poor; and it seldom
happened that poverty and distress were not relieved by
him, when application was made to him by the needy. Although
many of the more original kind of Gipsies have a
respectable appearance, and may possess a little money,
during the prime of life, yet the most of them, in their old
age, are in a condition of poverty and misery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>Charles Wilson had a family of very handsome daughters,
one of whom was considered a perfect beauty. She did not
travel the country, like the rest of her family, but remained
at home, and acted as her father&#8217;s housekeeper; and, when
any of the tribe visited him, they always addressed her by
the title of &#8220;my lady,&#8221; (<i>raunie</i>,) and otherwise treated her
with great respect. This beautiful girl was, about the year
1795, kept as a mistress by an adjutant of a Scotch regiment
of fencible cavalry. She was frequently seen as handsomely
and fashionably attired as the first females in Stirling; and
some of the troopers were not displeased to see their adjutant&#8217;s
mistress equal in appearance to the highest dames in
the town. But Wilson&#8217;s daughters were all frequently
dressed in a very superior manner, and could not have been
taken for Gipsies.</p>

<p>To suit their purposes of deception, in practising their
pilfering habits, the female Gipsies, as well as the males,
often changed their wearing apparel. Some of them have
been seen in four different dresses in one fair day, varying
from the appearance of a sturdy female beggar to that of a
young, flirting wench, fantastically dressed, and throwing
herself, a perfect lure, in the way of the hearty, ranting,
half-intoxicated, and merry young farmers, for the sole purpose
of stripping them of their money.<a name="FNanchor109" id="FNanchor109"></a><a href="#Footnote109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> The following is
given as an instance of this sort of female deception:&mdash;On a
fair-day, in the town of Kinross, a Brae-laird,<a name="FNanchor110" id="FNanchor110"></a><a href="#Footnote110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> in the same
county, fell in with a Gipsy harpy of the above character,
of the name of Wilson, one of Charles&#8217; daughters, it was
understood. She had a fine person, an agreeable and prepossessing
countenance, was handsomely dressed, and was,
altogether, what one would pronounce a pretty girl. Her
charms made a very sudden and deep impression on the susceptible
laird; and as it was an easy matter, in those times,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
to make up acquaintance at these large and promiscuous
gatherings, the enamoured rustic soon found means to introduce
himself to the stranger lady. He treated her in a
gallant manner, and engaged to pay his respects to her at
her place of residence. It happened, however, that a number
of Tinklers were, that very evening, apprehended in the
fair, for picking pockets, and a great many purses were
found in their custody. Proclamation was made by the
authorities, that all those who had lost their money should
appear at a place named, and identify their property. The
Brae-laird, among others, missed his pocket-book and purse,
and accordingly went to enquire after them. His purse was
produced to him; but greatly was he ashamed and mortified
when the thief was also shown to him, lying in prison&mdash;the
very person of his handsome and beautiful sweetheart, now
metamorphosed into a common Tinkler wench. Whether he
now provoked the ire of his dulcinea, by harsh treatment, is
not mentioned; but the woman sent, as it were, a dagger to
his heart, by calling out before all present: &#8220;Ay, laird, ye&#8217;re
no sae kind to me noo, lad, as when ye treated me wi&#8217; wine
in the forenoon.&#8221; The man, confounded at his exposure,
was glad to get out of her presence, and, rather than bear
the cutting taunts of the Gipsy, fled from the place of investigation,
leaving his money behind him.<a name="FNanchor111" id="FNanchor111"></a><a href="#Footnote111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>It is almost needless to mention that the Stirlingshire
Gipsies contributed their full proportion to the list of victims
to the offended laws of the country. Although Charles
Wilson, the chieftain of the horde, dexterously eluded justice
himself, two of his brothers were executed within the memory
of people still living. Another of his relatives, of the
name of Gordon, also underwent the last penalty of the law,
at Glasgow, where an acquaintance of mine saw him hanged.
Wilson had a son who carried a box of jewelry through the
country, and was suspected of having been concerned in
robbing a bank, at, I believe, Dunkeld. Some of the descendants
of this Stirlingshire tribe still roam up and down
the kingdom, nearly in the old Gipsy manner; and several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
of them have their residence, when not on the tramp, in the
town of Stirling.</p>

<p>The great distinguishing feature in the character of the
Gipsies is an incurable propensity for theft and robbery,
and taking openly and forcibly (sorning) whatever answers
their purpose. A Gipsy, of about twenty-one years of age,
stated to me that his forefathers considered it quite lawful,
among themselves, to take from others, not of their own fraternity,
any article they stood in need of. Casting his eyes
around the inside of my house, he said: &#8220;For instance, were
they to enter this room, they would carry off anything that
could be of service to them, such as clothes, money, victuals,
&amp;c.:&#8221; &#8220;but,&#8221; added he, &#8220;all this proceeded from ignorance;
they are now quite changed in their manners.&#8221; Another
Gipsy, a man of about sixty years of age, informed me that
the tribe have a complete and thorough hatred of the whole
community, excepting those who shelter them, or treat them
with kindness; and that a dexterous theft or robbery, committed
on any of the natives among whom they travel, is
looked upon as one of the most meritorious actions which a
Gipsy can possibly perform.</p>

<p>But the Gipsies are by no means the only nation in the world
that have considered theft reputable. In Sparta, under the
celebrated law-giver Lycurgus, theft was also reputable. In
Hugh Murray&#8217;s account of an embassy from Portugal to the
Emperor of Abyssinia, in 1620, we find the following curious
passage relative to thieves in that part of the world: &#8220;As
the embassy left the palace, a band of thieves carried off a
number of valuable articles, while a servant who attempted
to defend them was wounded in the leg. The ambassadors,
enquiring the mode of obtaining redress for this outrage,
were assured that these thieves formed a regular part of the
court establishment, and that officers were appointed who
levied a proportion of the articles stolen, for behoof his imperial
majesty.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor112" id="FNanchor112"></a><a href="#Footnote112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> In another part of Africa, there is a horde
of Moors who go by the name of the tribe of thieves. This
wandering, vagabond horde do not blush at adopting this
odious denomination. Their chief is called chief of the
tribe of thieves.<a name="FNanchor113" id="FNanchor113"></a><a href="#Footnote113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> In Hugh Murray&#8217;s Asia, we have the following
passage relative to the professed thieves in India.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>&#8220;Nothing tends more to call in question the mildness of
the Hindoo disposition than the vast scale of the practice
of decoity. This term, though essentially synonymous with
robbery, suggests, however, very different ideas. With us,
robbers are daring and desperate outlaws, who hide themselves
in the obscure corners of great cities, shunned and
detested by all society. In India, they are regular and
reputable persons, who have not only houses and families,
but often landed property, and have much influence in the
villages where they reside. This profession, like all others,
is hereditary; and a father has been heard, from the gallows,
carefully admonishing his son not to be deterred, by his fate,
from following the calling of his ancestors. They are very
devout, and have placed themselves under the patronage of
the goddess Kali, revered in Bengal above all other deities,
and who is supposed to look with peculiar favour on achievements
such as theirs. They are even recognized by the old
Hindoo laws, which contain enactments for the protection
of stolen goods, upon a due share being given to the magistrate.
They seldom, however, commit depredations in their
own village, or even in that immediately adjoining, but seek
a distant one, where they have no tie to the inhabitants.
They are formed into bands, with military organization, so
that when a chief dies, there is always another ready to succeed
him. They calculate that they have ten chances to one
of never being brought to justice.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old Hindoo law alluded to in the above passage is, I
presume, the following enactment in the Gentoo Code, translated
by Nathaniel Brassey Halhed, page 146: &#8220;The mode
of shares among robbers is this: If any thieves, by the command
of the magistrate, and with his assistance, have committed
depredations upon, and brought any booty from, another
province, the magistrate shall receive a share of
one-sixth of the whole; if they receive no command or
assistance from the magistrate, they shall give the magistrate,
in that case, one-tenth of his share; and of the
remainder, their chief shall receive four shares: and whosoever
among them is perfect master of his occupation, shall
receive three shares; also whichever of them is remarkably
strong and stout, shall receive two shares; and the rest shall
receive each one share. If any one of the community of
thieves happens to be taken, and should be released from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
the Cutchery, (court of justice), upon payment of a sum of
money, all the thieves shall make good that sum by equal
shares.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;In the Gentoo code containing this law, there
are many severe enactments against theft and robbery of
every description; but these laws refer to domestic disturbers
of their own countrymen, or violators of the first principles
of society. The law which regulates these shares of robbers,
refers only to such bold and hardy adventurers as sally forth
to levy contributions in a foreign province.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now our Gipsies are, in one point, exactly on a level with
the adventurers here mentioned. They look upon themselves
as being in a foreign land, and consider it fair game to rob,
plunder, and cheat all and every one of the &#8220;strangers&#8221;
among whom they travel. I am disposed to believe that
there were also rules among the Gipsy bands for dividing
their booty, something like the old Hindoo law alluded to.<a name="FNanchor114" id="FNanchor114"></a><a href="#Footnote114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>We find the following curious particulars mentioned of a
tribe among the mountains in India, who are supposed to be
the aborigines of Hindostan. They are called Kookies or
Lunctas. &#8220;Next to personal valour, the accomplishment
most esteemed in a warrior is superior address in stealing;
and if a thief can convey, undiscovered, to his own house,
his neighbour&#8217;s property, it cannot afterwards be reclaimed;
nor, if detected in the act, is he otherwise punished than by
exposure to the ridicule of the Porah, and being obliged to
restore what he may have laid hold of.&#8221; &#8220;It is a great
recommendation in obtaining a wife, when a Kookie can
say that his house is full of stolen articles.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor115" id="FNanchor115"></a><a href="#Footnote115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> There are
several other tribes in the world among whom theft and robbery
are considered meritorious actions. It appears that
among the Coords &#8220;no one is allowed to marry a wife till
he has committed some great act of robbery or murder.&#8221; In
an account of Kamtschatka, it is mentioned that &#8220;among all
these barbarous nations, excepting the Kamtschadales, theft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
is reputable, provided they do not steal in their own tribe,
or if done with such art as to prevent discovery: on the
other hand, it is punished very severely if discovered; not
for the theft, but for the want of address in the art of stealing.
A Tschukotskoe girl cannot be married before she has
shown her dexterity in this way.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor116" id="FNanchor116"></a><a href="#Footnote116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>Halhed, in apologizing for the Hindoo magistrate participating
in the plunder of banditti, which applies equally well
to the Gipsies, remarks that, &#8220;unjust as this behaviour may
appear in the eye of equity, it bears the most genuine stamp
of antiquity, and corresponds entirely with the manners of
the early Grecians, at or before the period of the Trojan
war, and of the western nations before their emersion from
barbarism; a practice still kept up among the piratic States
of Barbary, to its fullest extent by sea, and probably among
many hordes of Tartars and Arabian banditti by land.&#8221; It
is proper to mention that the Gipsies seldom or never steal
from one another; at least, I never could find out an instance
of a theft having been committed by a Gipsy on one of his
own tribe.</p>

<p>It will be seen, from the following details, that the sanguinary
laws which have been, from time to time, promulgated
all over Europe against the Gipsies, were not enacted
to put down fanciful crimes, as an author of the present day
seems, in his travels, to insinuate. To plunder the community
with more safety to their persons, the Gipsies appear
to have had a system of theft peculiar to themselves. Those
of Lochgellie trained all their children to theft. Indeed,
this has been the general practice with the tribe all over
Scotland. Several individuals have mentioned to me that
the Lochgellie band were exercised in the art of thieving
under the most rigid discipline. They had various ways of
making themselves expert thieves. They frequently practised
themselves by picking the pockets of each other.
Sometimes a pair of breeches were made fast to the end of
a string, suspended from a high part of the tent, kiln, or
outhouse in which they happened to be encamped. The
children were set at work to try if they could, by sleight of
hand, abstract money from the pockets of the breeches hanging
in this position, without moving them. Sometimes they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
used bells in this discipline. The children who were most
expert in abstracting the money in this manner, were rewarded
with applause and presents; while, on the other hand, those
who proved awkward, by ringing the bell, or moving the
breeches, were severely chastised. After the youths were
considered perfect in this branch of their profession, a purse,
or other small object, was laid down in an exposed part of
the tent or camp, in view of all the family. While the
ordinary business of the Gipsies was going forward, the
children again commenced their operations, by exerting their
ingenuity and exercising their patience, in trying to carry
off the purse without being perceived by any one present.
If they were detected, they were again beaten; but if they
succeeded unnoticed, they were caressed and liberally rewarded.
As far as my information goes, this systematic
training of the Gipsy youth was performed by the chief
female of the bands. These women seem to have had great
authority over their children. Ann Brown, of the Lochgellie
tribe, could, by a single stamp of her foot, cause the
children to crouch to the ground, like trembling dogs under
the lash of an angry master. The Gipsies, from these constant
trainings, became exceedingly dexterous at picking
pockets. The following instance of their extraordinary address
in these practices, will show the effects of their careful
training, as well as exhibit the natural ingenuity which they
will display in compassing their ends.</p>

<p>A principal male Gipsy, of a very respectable appearance,
whose name it is unnecessary to mention, happened, on a
market day, to be drinking in a public-house, with several
farmers with whom he was well acquainted. The party
observed, from the window, a countryman purchase something
at a stand in the market, and, after paying for it, thrust
his purse into his watch-pocket, in the band of his breeches.
One of the company remarked that it would be a very difficult
matter to rob the cautious man of his purse, without
being detected. The Gipsy immediately offered to bet two
bottles of wine that he would rob the man of his purse, in
the open and public market, without being perceived by him.
The bet was taken, and the Gipsy proceeded about the difficult
and delicate business. Going up to the unsuspecting
man, he requested, as a particular favour, if he would ease
the stock about his neck, which buckled behind&mdash;an article<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
of dress at that time in fashion. The countryman most
readily agreed to oblige the stranger gentleman&mdash;as he supposed
him to be. The Gipsy, now stooping down, to allow
his stock to be adjusted, placed his head against the countryman&#8217;s
stomach, and, pressing it forward a little, he reached
down one hand, under the pretence of adjusting his shoe,
while the other was employed in extracting the farmer&#8217;s
purse. The purse was immediately brought into the company,
and the cautious, unsuspecting countryman did not
know of his loss, till he was sent for, and had his property
returned to him.</p>

<p>The Gipsy youth, trained from infancy to plunder, in the
manner described, were formed into companies or bands,
with a captain at their head. These captains were generally
the grown-up sons of the old chieftains, who, having been
themselves leaders in their youth, endeavoured, in their old
age, to support, outwardly, a pretty fair character, although
under considerable suspicion. The captains were generally
well dressed, and could not be taken for Gipsies. The
youths varied in age from ten to thirty years. They travelled
to fairs singly, or at least never above two together,
while their captains almost always rode on horse-back, but
never in company with any of their men.<a name="FNanchor117" id="FNanchor117"></a><a href="#Footnote117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> The band consisted
of a great number of individuals, and in a fair several
of these companies would be present; each company acting
independent of the others, for behoof of its own members
and chief. Each chief, on such occasions, had his own headquarters,
to which his men repaired with their booty, as fast
as they obtained it. Some of the chiefs, handsomely dressed,
pretended to be busily employed in buying and selling horses,
but were always ready to attend to the operations of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
tribe, employed in plundering in the market. The purses
were brought to the horse-dealer by the members of his band,
who, to prevent being discovered, pretended to be buying
horses from him, while communicating with him relative to
their peculiar vocation. When a detection was likely to
take place, the chief mounted a good horse, and rode off to
a distant part of the country, previously made known to his
men, with the whole of the booty in his custody. To this
place the band, when all was quiet, repaired, and received
their share of the plunder. They could communicate information
to one another by signs, to say nothing of their language,
which frequently enabled them to get the start of
their pursuers. Like the fox, the dog, and the <i>corbie</i>, they
frequently concealed their stolen articles in the earth. Parties
of them would frequently commence sham fights in markets,
to facilitate the picking of the pockets of the people,
while crowded together to witness the scuffles.</p>

<p>Many of the male Gipsies used a piece of strong leather,
like a sailmaker&#8217;s palm, having a short piece of sharp steel,
like the point of a surgeon&#8217;s lancet, where the sailmaker has
his thimble. The long sleeves of their coats concealed the
instrument, and when they wished to cut a purse out of an
arm-pocket, they stretched out the arm, and ran it flatly and
gently along the cloth of the coat, opposite the pocket of the
individual they wished to plunder. The female Gipsies
wore, upon their forefingers, rings of a peculiar construction,
yet nothing unusual in their appearance, excepting their
very large size. On closing the hand, the pressure upon a
spring sent forth, through an aperture or slit in the ring, a
piece of sharp steel, something like the manner in which a
bee thrusts out and withdraws its sting. With these ingenious
instruments the female Gipsies cut the outside of the
pockets of their victims, exactly as a glazier runs his diamond
over a sheet of glass. The opening once made by the
back of the forefinger, the hand, following, was easily introduced
into the pocket. In the midst of a crowded fair, the
dexterous Gipsies, with their nimble fingers, armed with
these invisible instruments, cut the pocket-books and purses
of the honest farmers, as if they had been robbed by magic.
So skillful were the wife and one of the sisters of Charles
Wilson, in the art of thieving, that although the loss of the
pocket-book was, in some instances, immediately discovered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
nothing was ever found upon their persons by which their guilt
could be established. No instrument appeared in their possession
with which the clothes of the plundered individuals could
have been cut, as no one dreamt that the rings on their fingers
contained tools so admirably adapted for such purposes.</p>

<p>The Gipsy chiefs in Scotland appear, at one time, to have
received a share of the plundered articles in the same manner
as those of the same rank received from their inferiors
in Hungary. Grellmann says: &#8220;Whenever a complaint is
made that any of their people have been guilty of theft, the
Waywode (chief) not only orders a general search to be
made in every tent or hut, and returns the stolen goods to
the owner, if they can be found; but he punishes the thief,
in presence of the complainant, with his whip. He does not,
however, punish the aggressor from any regard to justice,
but rather to quiet the plaintiff, and at the same time to
make his people more wary in their thefts, as well as more
dexterous in concealing their prey. These very materially
concern him, since, by every discovery that is made, his income
suffers, as the whole profit of his office arises from his
share of the articles that are stolen. Every time any one
brings in a booty, he is obliged to give information to the
Arch-gipsy of his successful enterprise, then render a just account
of what and how much he has stolen, in order that the
proper division may be made. This is the situation in which
a Gipsy looks on himself as bound to give a fair and true
detail, though, in every other instance, he does not hesitate
to perjure himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>A shrewd and active magistrate, in the west of Fife, knew
our Scottish Gipsy depredators so well, that he caused them
all to be apprehended as they entered the fairs held in the
town in which he resided; and when the market, which lasted
for several days, was over, the Gipsies were released from
prison, with empty pockets and hungry bellies&mdash;most effectually
baffled in their designs.</p>

<p>Great numbers of these Gipsy plunderers, at one time,
crossed the Forth at the Queensferry, for the purpose of
stealing and robbing at the fairs in the north of Scotland.
They all travelled singly or in pairs. Very few persons
knew whence they came, or with whom they were connected.
They were, in general, well dressed, and could not have been
taken for Gipsies. Every one put up at a public-house, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
North Queensferry, kept by a Mr. McRitchie, already mentioned,
an inn well known in the neighbourhood for its good
fare, and much frequented by all classes of society. In this
house, on the morning after a fair in Dunfermline, when <i>their
business</i> was all over, and themselves not alarmed by detection,
or other scaring incidents, no fewer than fourteen of
these plunderers have frequently been seen sitting at breakfast,
with Captain Gordon, their commander, at their head.
The landlord&#8217;s son informed me that they ate and drank of
the best in the house, and paid most handsomely for everything
they called for. I believe they were among the best
customers the landlord had. Gipsies, however, are by no
means habitual drinkers, or tiplers; but when they do sit
down, it is, in the phraseology of the sea, a complete <i>blow-out</i>.
About this public-house, these Gipsies were perfectly
inoffensive, and remarkably civil to all connected with it.
They troubled or stole from none of the people about the inn,
nor from those who lodged in the house, while they were
within doors, or in the immediate neighbourhood. Anything
could have been trusted with them on these occasions. At
these meetings, the landlord&#8217;s son frequently heard them
talking in the Gipsy language. Gordon, at times, paid the
reckoning for the whole, and transacted any other business
with the landlord; but, when the Gipsy company was intermixed
with females, which was commonly the case, each
individual paid his own share of the bill incurred. It
was sometimes the practice with the young bands to leave
their reckoning to be paid by their chiefs, who were not present,
but who, perhaps next day, came riding up, and paid
the expenses incurred by their men. I am informed that
two chiefs, of the names of Wilson and Brown, often paid the
expenses of their bands in this way. When any of these
principal Gipsies happened to remain in the public-house all
night, they behaved very genteelly. They paid the chamber-maid,
boots, and waiter with more liberality than was the
custom with mercantile travellers generally. Captain Gordon,
just mentioned, assumed very considerable consequence
at this place. Frequently he hired boats and visited the
islands in the Forth, and adjacent coasts, like a gentleman
of pleasure. On one occasion he paid no less than a guinea,
with brandy and eatables <i>ad libitum</i>, to be rowed over to
Inch-colm, a distance of four miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>The female Gipsies from the south, on visiting their friends
at Lochgellie, in the depth of winter, often hired horses at
the North Queensferry, and rode, with no small pomp and
pride, to the village. Sometimes two females would ride
upon one horse. A very decent old man, of the name of
Thomas Chalmers, a small farmer, informed me that he himself
had rode to Lochgellie, with a female Gipsy behind him,
accompanied by other two, mounted on another of his horses,
riding with much spirit and glee by his side. Chalmers
said that these women not only paid more than the common
hire, but treated the owners of the horses with as much meat
and drink as they could take. The male Gipsies also hired
horses at this Ferry, with which they rode to markets in the
north.</p>

<p>The young Gipsies, male and female, of whom I have
spoken, appear to have been the flower of the different bands,
collected and employed in a general plundering at the fairs
in the north. So well did they pay their way at the village
and passage alluded to, that the boatmen gave them the
kindly name of &#8220;our frien&#8217;s.&#8221; These wanderers were all
known at the village by the name of &#8220;Gillie Wheesels,&#8221; or
&#8220;Killie Wheesh,&#8221; which, in the west of Fife, signified &#8220;the
lads that take the purses.&#8221; Old Thomas Chalmers informed
me that he had frequently seen these sharks of boatmen
shake these Gipsy thieves heartily by the hand, and, with a
significant smile on their harsh, weather-beaten countenances,
wish them a good market, as they landed them on the north
side of the Forth, on their way to picking pockets at fairs.</p>

<p>As an incident in the lives of these Gipsies, I will give
the following, which was witnessed by Chalmers: A Gillie
of a Gipsy horse-couper stole a black colt, in the east of
Fife, and carried it direct to a fair in Perth, where he exchanged
it for a white horse, belonging to a Highlander
wearing a green kilt. The Highlander, however, had not
long put the colt into the stable, before word was brought to
him that it was gone. Suspecting the Gipsy of the theft,
the sturdy Gael proceeded in search of him, and receiving
positive information of the fact, he pursued him, like a
staunch hound on the warm foot of reynard, till he overtook
him in a house on the north side of Kinross. The Gipsy
was taking some refreshment in the same room with Chalmers,
when the Highlander, in a storm of broken English,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
burst into their presence. The astute and polished Gipsy
instantly sprang to his feet, and, throwing his arms around
the foaming Celt, embraced and hugged him in the eastern
manner, overpowering him with expressions of joy at seeing
him again. This quite exasperated the mountaineer: almost
suffocated with rage, he shook the Gipsy from his person,
with the utmost disdain, and demanded the colt he had
stolen from him. Notwithstanding the deceitful embraces
and forced entreaties of the Gipsy, he was, with the assistance
of a messenger, at the back of the Highlander, safely
lodged in the jail of Cupar.</p>

<p>Considering the great aptitude which the Gipsies have
always shown for working in metals, it is not surprising that
they should have resorted to coining, among their many expedients
for circumventing and plundering the &#8220;strangers&#8221;
among whom they sojourn. The following instance will
illustrate the singular audacity which they can display in
this branch of their profession: As an honest countryman,
of much simplicity of character, of the name of W&mdash;&mdash; O&mdash;&mdash;,
was journeying along the public road, a travelling Tinkler,
whom he did not know, chanced to come up to him. After
walking and conversing for some time, the courteous Gipsy,
on arriving at a public-house, invited him to step in, and
have a &#8220;tasting.&#8221; They accordingly entered the house, and
had no sooner finished one half <i>mutchken</i>, than the liberal
wanderer called for another; but when the reckoning came
to be thought of, the countryman was surprised when his
friend the Tinkler declared that he had not a coin in his
possession. Unfortunately, the honest man happened also to
be without a farthing in his pocket, and how they were to
get out of the house, without paying the landlord, whom
neither of them knew, puzzled him not a little. While
meditating over their dilemma, the Gipsy, with his eyes
rolling about in every direction, as is their wont, espied a
pewter basin under a bed in the room. This was all he required.
Bolting the door of the apartment, he opened his
budget, and, taking out a pair of large shears, cut a piece
from the side of the basin, and, putting it into his crucible
on the fire, in no time, with his coining instruments, threw
off several half-crowns, resembling good, sterling money. If
the simple countryman was troubled at not being able to
pay his reckoning, he was now terrified at being locked up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
with a man busily engaged in coining base money from an
article stolen in the very apartment in which he was confined.
He expected, every moment, some one to burst the
door open, and apprehend them, while the Tinkler had all
his coining apparatus about him. His companion, however,
was not in the least disturbed, but deliberately finished his
coin in a superior manner, and cutting the remainder of the
basin into pieces, packed it into his wallet. Unlocking the
door, he rang the bell, and tendered one of his half-crowns
to his host, to pay his score, which was accepted without a
suspicion. The Tinkler then offered his fellow-traveller part
of his remaining coin; but the unsophisticated man, far
from touching one of them, was only too glad to rid himself
of so dangerous an acquaintance. The Gipsy, on his part,
marched off, with his spirits elevated with liquor, and his
pockets replenished with money, smiling at the simplicity
and terror of the countryman.</p>

<p>However numerous the crimes which the Gipsies have
committed, or the murders they have perpetrated in their
own tribe, yet, in justice to them, I must say that only two
instances have come to my knowledge of their having put to
death natives of Scotland who were not of their own fraternity.
One of these instances was that of a man of the name
of Adam Thomson, whom they murdered because he had encroached,
it was said, upon one of their supposed privileges&mdash;that
of gathering rags through the country. Amongst
other acts of cruelty, they placed the poor man on a fire, in
his own house. Two Gipsies were tried for the murder, but
whether they were both executed, I do not know. The following
particulars connected with this deed will show
how exactly the Gipsies know the different routes and halting-places
of each band, as they travel through the country.
Indeed, I have been informed that the track which each
horde is to take, the different stages, and the number of
days they are to remain at each place, are all marked out
and fixed upon in the spring, before they leave their winter
residence. One of the Gipsies concerned in the murder of
Thomson lay in prison, in one of the towns in the south of
Scotland, for nearly twelve months, without having had any
communication with his tribe. There was not sufficient evidence
against him to justify his being brought to trial; nor
would he give any information regarding the transaction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
At last he changed his mind, and told the authorities they
would find the murderer at a certain spot in the Highlands,
on a certain day and hour of that day; but if he could not
be found there, they were to proceed to another place, at
twenty miles&#8217; distance, where they would be sure to find
him.</p>

<p>The murderer was found at the place, and on the day,
mentioned by the Gipsy. But, on entering the house, the
constables could not discover him, although they knew he
had been within its walls a few minutes before they approached
it. A fire having been kindled in the house, a
noise was heard in the chimney, which attracted the notice
of the constables; and, on examination, they found the object
of their search; the heat and smoke having caused him
to become restless in his place of concealment. He was secured,
and some of the country-people were called upon to
assist in carrying him to Edinburgh. The prisoner was bound
into a cart with ropes, to prevent him making his escape;
the party in charge of him being aware of the desperate
character of the man. Nothing particular occurred on the
road, until after they had passed the town of Linlithgow,
when, to their astonishment, they found a woman in the pangs
of labour, in the open field. She called upon them either to
bring her a midwife, or take her to one; a claim that could
not be resisted. She was accordingly put into the cart, beside
the prisoner, and driven with all speed to a place where
a midwife could be procured. On arriving opposite a dell,
full of trees and bushes, about the west-end of Kirkliston,
the guards were confounded at seeing their prisoner, all at
once, spring out of the cart, and, darting into the cover,
vanish in an instant. Pursuit was immediately given, and,
in the excitement, the unfortunate woman was left to her
fate. In searching for the Gipsy, they met a gentleman
shooting in the neighbourhood, who had observed a man hide
himself among the bushes. On going to the spot, they found
the criminal, lying like a fox in his hole. The sportsman,
presenting his gun, threatened to blow out his brains, if he
did not come out, and deliver himself up to the constables.
On returning with him to the cart, his captors, to their astonishment,
found that the woman in labour had also vanished.
It is needless to add that she was a Gipsy, who had
feigned being in travail, and, while in the cart, had cut the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
ropes with which the prisoner was bound, to enable him to
make his escape.</p>

<p>The female Gipsies have had recourse to many expedients
in their impositions on the public. The following is an instance,
of a singular nature, that took place a good many
years ago. When it is considered that the Gipsies, in their
native country,<a name="FNanchor118" id="FNanchor118"></a><a href="#Footnote118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> would not be encumbered with much wearing-apparel,
but would go about in a state little short of
nudity, the extreme indecency of such an action will appear
somewhat lessened. The inhabitants of Winchburgh and
neighbourhood were one day greatly astonished at beholding
a female, with a child in her arms, walking along the
road, as naked as when she was born. She stated to the
country-people that she had just been plundered, and stripped
of every article of her wearing-apparel, by a band of
Tinklers, to whom she pointed, lying in a field hard by. She
submitted her piteous condition to the humanity of the inhabitants,
and craved any sort of garment to cover her nakedness.
The state in which she was found left not the slightest
doubt on the minds of the spectators as to the truth of her
representations. Almost every female in the neighbourhood
ran with some description of clothing to the unfortunate
woman; so that, in a short time, she was not only comfortably
clad, but had many articles of dress to spare. Shortly
after, she left the town, and proceeded on her journey. But
some one, observing her motions more closely than the rest,
was astonished at seeing her go straight to the very Tinklers
who, she said, had stripped her. Her appearance among
her band convulsed them all with laughter, at the dexterous
trick she had played upon the simple inhabitants.</p>

<p>The following anecdote, related to me of one of the well-attired
female Gipsies, belonging to the Stirling horde, will
illustrate the gratitude which the Scottish Gipsies have, on
all occasions, shown to those who have rendered them acts
of kindness and attention: A person, belonging to Stirling,
had rendered himself obnoxious to the Gipsies, by giving
information relative to one of the gang, of the name of Hamilton,
whom he had observed picking a man&#8217;s pocket of
forty pounds in a fair at Doune. Hamilton was apprehended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
immediately after committing the theft, but none of the
money was found upon him. The informer, however, was
marked out for destruction by the band, for his officious conduct;
and they only waited a convenient opportunity to
put their resolution into execution. Some time afterwards,
the proscribed individual had occasion to go to a market at
no great distance from Stirling, and while on his way to it,
he observed, on the road before him, a female, in the attire
of a lady, riding on horseback. On coming to a pond at the
road-side, the horse suddenly made for the water, and threw
down its head to drink. Not being prepared for the movement,
the rider was thrown from her seat, with considerable
violence, to the ground. The proscribed individual, observing
the accident, ran forward to her assistance; but, being
only slightly stunned, she was, with his help, safely placed
in her seat again. She now thanked him for his kind and
timely assistance, and informed him of the conspiracy that
had been formed against him. She said it was particularly
fortunate for him that such an accident had befallen her
under the circumstances; for, in consequence of the information
he had given about the pocket-picking at Doune, he
was to have been way-laid and murdered; that very night
having been fixed upon for carrying the resolution into effect.
But, as he had shown her this kindness, she would
endeavour to procure, from her people, a pardon for him,
for the past. She then directed him to follow slowly, while
she would proceed on, at a quick pace, and overtake some
of her people, to whom she would relate her accident, and
the circumstances attending it. She then informed him that
if she waved her <i>hand</i>, upon his coming in sight of herself
and her people, he was to retrace his steps homeward, there
being then no mercy for him; but if she waved her <i>handkerchief</i>,
he might advance without fear. To his heart-felt
delight, on coming near the party, the signal of peace
was given, when he immediately hastened forward to the
spot. The band, who had been in deliberation upon his
fate, informed him that the lady&#8217;s intercession had prevailed
with them to spare his life; and that now he might consider
himself safe, provided he would take an oath, there
and then, never again to give evidence against any of
their people, or speak to any one about their practices,
should he discover them. The person in question deemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
it prudent, under all the circumstances of the case, to take
the oath; after which, nothing to his hurt, in either purse
or person, ever followed.<a name="FNanchor119" id="FNanchor119"></a><a href="#Footnote119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> The lady, thus equipped, and
possessed of so much influence, was the chief female of
the Gipsy band, to whom all the booty obtained at the fair
was brought, at the house where she put up at for the day.
It would seem that she was determined to save her friend
at all events; for, had her band not complied with her
wishes, the waving of her hand&mdash;the signal for him to make
his escape&mdash;would have defeated their intentions for that
time.</p>

<p>When occurrences of so grave and imposing a nature as
the above are taken into consideration, the fear and awe
with which the Gipsies have inspired the community are not
to be wondered at.</p>

<p>The Gipsies at Lochgellie had a dance peculiar to themselves,
during the performance of which they sung a song,
in the Gipsy language, which they called a &#8220;croon.&#8221; A
Gipsy informed me that it was exactly like the one old
Charles Stewart, and other Gipsies, used to perform, and
which I will describe. At the wedding near Corstorphine,
which Charles Stewart attended, as already mentioned, there
were five or six female Gipsies in his train. On such occasions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
he did not allow males to accompany him. At some
distance from the people at the wedding, but within hearing
of the music, the females formed themselves into a ring, with
Charles in the centre. Here, in the midst of the circle, he
danced and capered in the most antic and ludicrous manner,
sweeping his cudgel around his body in all directions, and
moving with much grace and agility. Sometimes he danced
round the outside of the circle. The females danced and
courtesied to him, as he faced about and bowed to them.
When they happened to go wrong, he put them to rights by
a movement of his cudgel; for it was by the cudgel that all
the turns and figures of the dance were regulated. A twirl
dismissed the females; a cut recalled them; a sweep made
them squat on the ground; a twist again called them up, in
an instant, to the dance. In short, Stewart distinctly spoke
to his female dancers by means of his cudgel, commanding
them to do whatever he pleased, without opening his mouth
to one of them.</p>

<p>George Drummond, a Gipsy chief of an inferior gang in
Fife, danced with his seraglio of females, amounting sometimes
to half a dozen, in the same manner as Stewart, without
the slightest variation, excepting that his gestures were,
on some occasions, extremely lascivious. He threw himself
into almost every attitude in which the human body can be
placed, while his cudgel was flying about his person with
great violence. All the movements of the dance were regulated
by the measures of an indecent song, at the chorus of
which the circular movements of Drummond&#8217;s cudgel ceased;
when one of the females faced about to him, and joined him
with her voice, the gestures of both being exceedingly obscene.
Drummond&#8217;s appearance, while dancing, has been
described to me, by a gentleman who has often seen him performing,
as exactly like what is called a &#8220;jumping-jack&#8221;&mdash;that
is, a human figure, cut out of wood or paste-board, with
which children often amuse themselves, by regulating its
ludicrous movements by means of strings attached to various
parts of it.</p>

<p>Dr. Clark, in his account of his travels through Russia,
gives a description of a Gipsy dance in Moscow, which is,
in all respects, very similar to that performed by Stewart
and Drummond. These travels came into my hands some time
after I had taken notes of the Scottish Gipsy dance. Napkins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
appear to have been used by the Russian Gipsies, where
sticks were employed by our Scottish tribes. No mention,
however, is made, by Dr. Clark, whether the females, in the
dance at Moscow, were guided by signs with the napkins, in
the manner in which Stewart and Drummond, by their cudgels,
directed their women in their dances. The eyes of the
females were constantly fixed upon Stewart&#8217;s cudgel. Dr.
Clark is of opinion that the national dance in Russia, called
the <i>barina</i>, is derived from the Gipsies; and thinks it probable
that our common hornpipe is taken from these wanderers.<a name="FNanchor120" id="FNanchor120"></a><a href="#Footnote120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>George Drummond was, in rank, quite inferior to the
Lochgellie band, who called him a &#8220;beggar Tinkler,&#8221; and
seemed to despise him. He always travelled with a number
of females in his company. These he married after the
custom of the Gipsies, and divorced some of them over the
body of a horse, sacrificed for the occasion; a description
of both of which ceremonies will be given in <a href="#Page_257">another chapter</a>.
He chastised his women with his cudgel, without
mercy, causing the blood to flow at every blow, and frequently
knocked them senseless to the ground; while he
would call out to them, &#8220;What the deevil are ye fighting
at&mdash;can ye no&#8217; &#8216;gree? I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s no&#8217; sae mony o&#8217;
ye!&#8221; although, perhaps, four would be engaged in the scuffle.
Such was this man&#8217;s impudence and audacity, that he sometimes
carried off the flesh out of the kail-pots of the farmers;
and so terrified were some of the inhabitants of Fife, at
some of the Gipsy women who followed him, that, the moment
they entered their doors, salt was thrown into the fire,
to set at defiance the witchcraft which they believed they
possessed. One female, called Dancing Tibby, was, in particular,
an object of apprehension and suspicion. In Drummond&#8217;s
journeys through the country, when he came at night
to a farmer&#8217;s premises, where he intended to lodge, and
found his place occupied by others of his gang, he, without
hesitation, turned them out of their quarters, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
took possession of their warm beds himself; letting them
shift for themselves as they best might. This man lived
till he was ninety years of age, and was, from his youth, impressed
with a belief that he would die in the house in
which he was born; although he had travelled a great part
of the continent, and, while in the army, had been in various
engagements. He fell sick when at some distance from the
place of his nativity, but he hired a conveyance, and drove
with haste to die on his favourite spot. To this house he
was allowed admittance, where he closed his earthly career,
in about forty-eight hours after his arrival. Like others of
his tribe, Drummond, at times, gave tokens of protection to
some of his particular friends, outside of the circle of his
own fraternity.</p>

<p>James Robertson, a Gipsy closely related to the Lochgellie
band, of whom I have already made mention, frequently
danced, with his wife and numerous sisters, in a particular
fashion, changing and regulating the figures of the
dance by means of a bonnet; being, I believe, the same
dance which I have attempted to describe as performed by
others of the tribe in Scotland. When his wife and sisters
got intoxicated, which was often the case, it was a wild and
extravagant scene to behold those light-footed damsels, with
loose and flowing hair, dancing, with great spirit, on the
grass, in the open field, while James was, with all his &#8220;might
and main,&#8221; like the devil playing to the witches, in &#8220;Tam
o&#8217; Shanter,&#8221; keeping the bacchanalians in fierce and animated
music. When like to flag in his exertions to please
them with his fiddle, they have been heard calling loudly to
him, like Maggy Lawder to Rob the Ranter, &#8220;Play up,
Jamie Robertson; if ever we do weel, it will be a wonder;&#8221;
being totally regardless of all sense of decorum and decency.</p>

<p>The Gipsies in Fife followed the same occupations, in all
respects, as those in other parts of Scotland, and were also
dexterous at all athletic exercises. They were exceedingly
fond of cock-fighting, and, when the season came round for
that amusement, many a good cock was missing from the
farm-yards. The Lochgellie band considered begging a disgrace
to their tribe. At times they were handsomely dressed,
wearing silver buckles in their shoes, gold rings on their
fingers, and gold and silver brooches in the bosoms of their
ruffled shirts. They killed, at Martinmass, fat cattle for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
their winter&#8217;s provisions, and lived on the best victuals the
country could produce. It is, I believe, the common practice,
among inferior Scotch traders, for those who receive money
to treat the payer, or return a trifle of the payment, called
a luck-penny: but, in opposition to this practice, the Lochgellie
Gipsies always treated those to whom they paid
money for what they purchased of them. They occasionally
attended the church, and sometimes got their children baptized;
but when the clergyman refused them that privilege,
they baptized them themselves. At their baptisms, they had
great feastings and drinkings. Their favourite beverage,
on such occasions, was oatmeal and whiskey, mixed. When
intoxicated, they were sometimes very fond of arguing and
expostulating with clergymen on points of morality. With
regard to the internal government of the Lochgellie Gipsies,
I can only find that they held consultations among themselves,
relative to their affairs, and that the females had
votes as well as the males, but that old Charles Graham had
the casting vote; while, in his absence, his wife, Ann Brown,
managed their concerns.</p>

<p>There is a strict division of property among the Gipsies;
community of goods having no place among them. The
heads of each family, although travelling in one band, manufacture
and vend their own articles of merchandise, for the
support of their own families. The following particulars
are illustrative of this fact among the Gipsies:&mdash;A farmer
in Fife, who would never allow them to kindle fires in his
out-houses, had a band of them, of about twenty-five persons,
quartered one night on his farm. Next morning, the chief
female borrowed from the family a large copper caldron,
used for the purposes of the dairy, with which she had requested
permission to cook the breakfast of the horde upon
the kitchen fire. This having been granted, each family
produced a small linen bag, (not the beggar&#8217;s wallet,) made
of coarse materials, containing oatmeal; of which at least
four were brought into the apartment. The female who
prepared the repast went regularly over the bags, taking
out the meal in proportion to the members of the families to
which they respectively belonged, and repeated her visits in
this manner till the porridge was ready to be served up.</p>

<p>I shall conclude my account of the Gipsies in Fife by
mentioning the curious fact that, within these sixty years, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
gentleman of considerable landed property, between the
Forth and the Tay, abandoned his relatives, and travelled
over the kingdom in the society of the Gipsies. He married
one of the tribe, of the name of Ogilvie, who had two
daughters to him. Sometimes he quartered, it is said, upon
his own estate, disguised, of course, among the gang, to the
great annoyance of his relatives, who were horrified at the
idea of his becoming a Tinkler, and alarmed at the claims
which he occasionally made upon the estate. His daughters
travel the country, at the present day, as common Gipsies.</p>

passage: &#8220;A singular set of vagrants existed long in Falkland,
called <i>Scrapies</i>, who had no other visible means of existence than a horse
or a cow. Their ostensible employment was the carriage of commodities
to the adjoining villages, and in the intervals of work they turned out their
cattle to graze on the Lomond Hill. Their excursions at night were long
and mysterious, for the pretended object of procuring coals, but they
roamed with their little carts through the country-side, securing whatever
they could lift, and plundering fields in autumn. Whenever any enquiry
was addressed to a Falkland <i>Scrapie</i> as to the support of his horse, the
ready answer was, &#8216;Ou, he gangs up the (Lomond) Hill, ye ken.&#8217; This is
now prevented; the Lomond is enclosed, and the <i>Scrapies</i> now manage
their affairs on the road-sides.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote101" id="Footnote101"></a><a href="#FNanchor101"><span class="label">[101]</span></a> Our author says that the Life of Peter Young was published. The
following particulars, quoted in an account of the Gipsies, in the sixteenth
volume of Chambers&#8217; Miscellany, are probably taken from that source:</p>

<p>&#8220;Peter was Captain of a band well known in the north of Scotland,
where his exploits are told to this day. Possessed of great strength of
body, and very uncommon abilities, he was a fine specimen of his race,
though he retained all their lawless propensities. He was proud, passionate,
revengeful, a great poacher, and an absolute despot, although a tolerably
just one, over his gang, maintaining his authority with an oak stick,
the principal sufferers from which were his numerous wives.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;He
esteemed himself to be a very honourable man, and the keepers of the
different public-houses in the country seem to have thought that, to a certain
extent, he was so. He never asked for trust as long as he had a half-penny
in his pocket. At the different inns which he used to frequent, he
was seldom or never denied anything. If he pledged his word that he
would pay his bill the next time he came that way, he punctually performed
his promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Peter&#8217;s work was that of a very miscellaneous nature. It comprehended
the profession of a blacksmith, in all its varieties, a tin-smith, and brazier.
His original business was to mend pots, pans, kettles, &amp;c., of every description,
and this he did with great neatness and ingenuity. Having an uncommon
turn for mechanics, he at last cleaned and repaired clocks and
watches. He could also engrave on wood or metal; so also could his
brother John; but where they learned any of these arts I never heard.
Peter was very handy about all sorts of carpenter work, and occasionally
amused himself, when the fancy seized him, in executing some pieces of
curious cabinet work that required neatness of hand. He was particularly
famous in making fishing-rods, and in the art of fishing he was surpassed
by few.&#8221;</p>

<p>Immediately before <i>one</i> of the days fixed for his execution, he seized the
jailer, and, upon the threat of instant death, compelled him to lay on his
back, as one dead, till he had set at liberty every one in the prison, himself
being the last to leave the building. After travelling twenty-four miles,
he went to sleep in the snow, and was apprehended by a company of sportsmen,
whose dogs had made a dead set at him. On being taken to the gallows,
one of the crowd cried: &#8220;Peter, deny you are the man!&#8221;&mdash;which he
did, declaring that his name was John Anderson, and wondered what the
people wanted with him. And there being none present who could identify
him, although he was well known in Aberdeen, he managed to get off
clear.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote102" id="Footnote102"></a><a href="#FNanchor102"><span class="label">[102]</span></a> Besides getting themselves out of scrapes in such an adroit manner, the
Scotch Gipsies have been known to serve a friend, when innocently placed
in a position of danger. It happened once that Billy Marshall, the Gipsy
chief in Gallowayshire, attacked and robbed the laird of Bargally, and in
the tussle lost his cap. A respectable farmer, passing by, some time afterwards,
picked up the cap, and put it on his head. The laird, with his mind
confused by the robbery and the darkness combined, accused the farmer of
the crime; and it would have gone hard with him at the trial, had not
Billy come to his rescue. He seized the cap, in the open court, and, putting
it on his head, addressed the laird: &#8220;Look at me, sir, and tell me, by the
oath you have sworn, am not I the man that robbed you?&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;By heaven!
you are the very man.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;You see what sort of memory this gentleman
has,&#8221; exclaimed the Gipsy; &#8220;he swears to the bonnet, whatever features
are under it. If you, yourself, my lord, will put it on your head, he will
be willing to swear that your lordship was the person who robbed him.&#8221;
The farmer was unanimously acquitted.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Billy&#8217;s courage in &#8220;taking care of the <i>living</i>,&#8221; an anecdote
is related of his having been frightened almost out of his wits, under
very ludicrous circumstances. He and his gang had long held possession
of a cavern in Gallowayshire, where they usually deposited their plunder,
and sometimes resided, secure from the officers of the law. Two Highland
pipers, strangers to the country, happened to enter it, to rest themselves
during the night. They perceived, at once, the character of its absent inhabitants;
and they were not long within it, before they were alarmed by
the voices of a numerous band advancing to its entrance. The pipers,
expecting nothing but death from the ruthless Gipsies, had the presence of
mind to strike up a pibroch, with tremendous fury; at the terrific reception
of which&mdash;the yelling of the bag-pipes issuing from the bowels of the
earth&mdash;Billy and his gang precipitately fled, as before a blast from the infernal
regions, and never afterwards dared to visit their favourite haunt. The
pipers, as might naturally be expected, carried off, in the morning, the
spoils of the redoubted Gipsies.&mdash;<i>Sir Walter Scott.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote103" id="Footnote103"></a><a href="#FNanchor103"><span class="label">[103]</span></a> It is interesting to notice that the three criminals who gave occasion to
the Porteous mob, in 1736, were named Stewart, Wilson and Robertson.
They were doubtless Gipsies of the above mentioned clans. Their crimes
and modes of escape were quite in keeping with the character of the Gipsies.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote104" id="Footnote104"></a><a href="#FNanchor104"><span class="label">[104]</span></a> Grellmann, in giving an account of the attire of the poorer kind of Hungarian
Gipsies, says: We are not to suppose however that they are indifferent
about dress; on the contrary, they love fine clothes to an extravagant
degree. Whenever an opportunity offers of acquiring a good coat,
either by gift, purchase, or theft, the Gipsy immediately bestirs himself to
become master of it. Possessed of the prize, he puts it on directly, without
considering in the least whether it suits the rest of his apparel. If his
dirty shirt had holes in it as big as a barn door, or his breeches so out of
condition that any one might, at the first glance, perceive their antiquity;
were he unprovided with shoes and stockings, or a covering for his head;
none of these defects would prevent his strutting about in a laced coat,
feeling himself of still greater consequence in case it happened to be a red
one. They are particularly fond of clothes which have been worn by people
of distinction, and will hardly ever deign to put on a boor&#8217;s coat. They
will rather go half naked, or wrap themselves up in a sack, than condescend
to wear a foreign garb. Green is a favourite colour with the Gipsies, but
scarlet is held in great esteem among them. It is the same with the Hungarian
female Gipsies. In Spain, they hang all sorts of trumpery in their
ears, and baubles around their necks.</p>

<p>Mr. Borrow says of the Spanish Gipsies, that there is nothing in the
dress of either sex differing from that of the other inhabitants. The same
may be said of the Scottish tribes, and even of those in England.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote106" id="Footnote106"></a><a href="#FNanchor106"><span class="label">[106]</span></a> The unabashed hardihood of the Gipsies, in the face of suspicion, or
even of open conviction, is not less characteristic than the facility with
which they commit crimes, or their address in concealing them. A Gipsy
of note, (known by the title of the &#8220;Earl of Hell&#8221;) was, about twenty years
ago, tried for a theft of a considerable sum of money at a Dalkeith market.
The proof seemed to the judge fully sufficient, but the jury rendered a verdict
of &#8220;not proven.&#8221; On dismissing the prisoner from the bar, the judge
informed him, in his own characteristic language, &#8220;That he had rubbit
shouthers wi&#8217; the gallows that morning;&#8221; and warned him not again to
appear there with a similar body of proof against him as it seemed scarcely
possible he should meet with another jury who would construe it as favourably.
His counsel tendered him a similar advice. The Gipsy, however,
replied, to the great entertainment of all around, &#8220;That he was proven
an innocent man, and that naebody had ony right to use siccan language
to him.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote107" id="Footnote107"></a><a href="#FNanchor107"><span class="label">[107]</span></a> The &#8220;game&#8221; of such a Gipsy may be fitly compared to that of a
sparrow-hawk. This bird has been known, while held in the hand, after
being wounded, to seize, when presented to it, a sparrow with each claw,
and a third with its beak.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote108" id="Footnote108"></a><a href="#FNanchor108"><span class="label">[108]</span></a> In the &#8220;Monthly Visitor&#8221; for February, 1856, will be found an account
of the conversion of one of this Gipsy clan, of the name of Jeanie Wilson.

<p><a name="Footnote109" id="Footnote109"></a><a href="#FNanchor109"><span class="label">[109]</span></a> An old woman, whom I found occupying the house of Charles Wilson,
at Raploch, in 1845, informed me that she had seen his wife in <i>five</i> different
dresses, in one market-day. She was, at the time, a servant in a <i>blacksmith&#8217;s</i>
family in Stirling, who were <i>great friends</i> of Charles Wilson; and
every time Mrs. Wilson came into the smith&#8217;s house, from her plundering
in the market, this servant girl, then nine years old, <i>cleaned her shoes</i> for a
fresh expedition in the crowd. When suspected, or even detected, in their
practices, these female Gipsies, by such change of dress and character,
easily escaped apprehension by the authorities.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote111" id="Footnote111"></a><a href="#FNanchor111"><span class="label">[111]</span></a> It is interesting to notice such rencounters between these pretty, genteel-looking
Gipsies and the ordinary natives. The denouement, in this instance,
might have been a marriage, and the plantation of a colony of Gipsies
among the Braes of Kinross-shire. The same might have happened in the
case of the other lady Wilson, with the adjutant at Stirling, or with one
of his acquaintances.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

glazier, whom we saw the next moment seeking for it in his pocket; the

Zealand peasants</i>, and my companion assured me that he would not
come out until he had pilfered some of the jewels that were shown to him.
In every part of the fair where there was a crowd, I met some of the
lodgers of the Duchess, (the inn kept by a Gipsy woman in which he had
spent the previous night.)&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p><a name="Footnote118" id="Footnote118"></a><a href="#FNanchor118"><span class="label">[118]</span></a> It is pretty certain that the Gipsies came from a warm country, for
they have no words for frost or snow, as will be seen in my enquiry into
the history of their language.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote119" id="Footnote119"></a><a href="#FNanchor119"><span class="label">[119]</span></a> Such interference with the Gipsies causes them much greater offence
than if the informer was a principal in the transaction. To such people,
their advice has always been: &#8220;Follow your nose, and let sleeping dogs
lie.&#8221; The following anecdote will illustrate the way in which they have
revenged themselves, under circumstances different from the above:</p>

<p>Old Will, of Phaup, at the head of Ettrick, was wont to shelter them for
many years. They asked nothing but house-room, and grass for their horses;
and, though they sometimes remained for several days, he could have
left every chest and press about the house open, with the certainty that
nothing would be missing; for, he said, &#8220;he aye ken&#8217;d fu&#8217; weel that the
toad wad keep his ain hole clean.&#8221; But it happened that he found one of
the gang, through the trick of a neighbouring farmer, feeding six horses on
the best piece of grass on his farm, which he was keeping for winter fodder.
A desperate combat followed, and the Gipsy was thrashed to his
heart&#8217;s content, and hunted out of the neighbourhood. A warfare of five
years&#8217; duration ensued between Will and the Gipsies. They nearly ruined
him, and, at the end of that period, he was glad to make up matters with
his old friends, and shelter them as formerly. He said he could have held
his own with them, had it not been for their warlockry; for nothing could
he keep from them&mdash;they once found his purse, though he had made his
wife bury it in the garden.&mdash;<i>Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine.</i> It is the afterclap that
keeps the people off the Gipsies, and secures for them a sort of toleration
wherever they go.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote120" id="Footnote120"></a><a href="#FNanchor120"><span class="label">[120]</span></a> If I am not mistaken, Col. Todd is of opinion that the Gipsies originally
came from Cabool, in Afghanistan. I will here give a description of
an Afghan dance, very like the Gipsy dance in Scotland. &#8220;The western
Afghans are fond of a particular dance called <i>Attum</i>, or <i>Ghoomboor</i>, in
which from fourteen to twenty people move, in strange attitudes, with shouting,
clapping of hands, and snapping of fingers, in a circle, round a single
person, who plays on an instrument in the centre.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Fraser&#8217;s Library.</i></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>TWEED-DALE AND CLYDESDALE GIPSIES.</h3>

<p>The county of Peebles, or Tweed-dale, appears to have
been more frequented by the Gipsies than, perhaps, any
other part of Scotland. So far back as the time of Henry
Lord Darnley, when the Gipsies were countenanced by the
government, we find, according to Buchanan, that this county
was a favourite resort of banditti; so much so, that when
Darnley took up his residence in Peebles, for the purpose of
shunning the company of his wife, Queen Mary, he &#8220;found
the place so cold, so infested with thieves, and so destitute
of provisions, that he was driven from it, to avoid being
fleeced and starved by rogues and beggars.&#8221; In the poems
of Dr. Pennecuik, as well as in his history of Peebles-shire,
published in the year 1715, the Gipsy bands are frequently
taken notice of. But, notwithstanding the attachment which
the tribe had for the romantic glens of Tweed-dale, no evidence
exists of their ever having had a permanent habitation
within the shire. They appear to have resorted to that pastoral
district during only the months of spring, summer and
autumn. Their partiality for this part of Scotland may be
attributed to three reasons.</p>

<p>The first reason is, Tweed-dale was part of the district in
which, if not the first, at least the second, Gipsy family in
Scotland claimed, at one time, a right to travel, as its own
peculiar privilege. The chief of this family was called Baillie,
who claimed kindred, in the bastard line, to one of the most
ancient families in the kingdom, of the name of Baillie, once
Balliol.<a name="FNanchor121" id="FNanchor121"></a><a href="#Footnote121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> In consequence of this alleged connexion, this
Gipsy family also claimed, as its right, to travel in the upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
ward of Lanarkshire, adjoining Tweed-dale, in which
district the Scottish family alluded to possessed estates;
and one of the principal places of the Gipsy rendezvous was
an old ruin, among the hills, in the upper part of the parish
of Lamington, or rather Wanel in those days.</p>

<p>The second reason is, that the surface of Tweed-dale is
much adapted to the wandering disposition of the Gipsies.
It is mountainous, but everywhere intersected by foot-paths
and bridle-roads, affording an easy passage to the Gipsies,
on foot or horseback. On its many hills are plenty of game;
and its infinite number of beautiful streams, including about
thirty-five miles of the highest part of the Tweed, abound
with trout of the finest quality. The Gipsies, being fond of
game, and much addicted to poaching and fishing, flocked to
Tweed-dale and the adjoining upland districts of a similar
character, comprehending some of the most remote and least
frequented parts in the south of Scotland. All these districts
being covered with vast flocks of sheep, many of which
were frequently dying of various diseases, the Gipsies never
wanted a plentiful supply of that sort of food from the families
of the store-masters.<a name="FNanchor122" id="FNanchor122"></a><a href="#Footnote122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>And the third reason is, that, in the pastoral districts in
the upper parts of the shires of Peebles, Selkirk, Dumfries,
and Lanark, including all that mountainous tract of land in
which the rivers Tweed, Annan and Clyde have their
sources, the Gipsies were, in a great measure, secure from
the officers of the law, and enjoyed their favourite amusements
without molestation or hindrance.</p>

<p>Before, and long after, the year 1745, the male branches
of the Baillies traversed Scotland, mounted on the best horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
to be found in the country; themselves dressed in long
coats, made of the finest scarlet and green cloth, ruffled at
hands and breast, booted and spurred; with cocked hats on
their heads, pistols in their belts, and broad-swords by their
sides: and at the heels of their horses followed greyhounds,
and other dogs of the chase, for their amusement. Some of
them assumed the manners and characters of gentlemen,
which they supported with wonderful art and propriety.
The females attended fairs in the attire of ladies, riding on
ponies, with side-saddles, in the best style. On these occasions,
the children were left in charge of their servants, perhaps
in an old out-house or hut, in some wild, sequestered
glen, in Tweed-dale or Clydesdale.</p>

<p>The greater part of the tenantry were kind to the Gipsies,
and many encouraged them to frequent their premises.
Tweed-dale being the favourite resort of the principal horde,
they generally abstained from injuring the property of the
greater part of the inhabitants. Indeed, I have been informed,
by eye-witnesses, that several of the farmers in
Tweed-dale and Clydesdale, at so late a period as about the
year 1770, accepted of entertainments from the principal
Gipsies, dining with them in the open fields, or in some old,
unoccupied out-house, or kiln. Their repast, on such occasions,
was composed of the best viands the country could
produce. On one occasion, a band dined on the green-sward,
near Douglass-mill, when the Gipsies drank their wine, after
dinner, as if they had been the best in the land. Some of
the landed proprietors, however, introduced clauses in their
leases prohibiting their tenants from harbouring the Gipsies;
and the Laird of Dolphington is mentioned as one.
The tribe, on hearing of the restriction, expressed great indignation
at the Laird&#8217;s conduct in adopting so effectual a
method of banishing them from the district. But so strong
were the attachments which some of the Gipsies displayed
towards the inhabitants, that the chief of the Ruthvens
actually wept like a child, whenever the misfortunes of the
ancient family of Murray, of Philliphaugh, were mentioned
to him.</p>

<p>In giving an account of the Gipsies who frequented
Tweed-dale, and the country adjacent, I have thought it proper
to mention particularly the family of Baillie; for this
family produced kings and queens, or, in their language,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
<i>baurie rajahs</i> and <i>baurie raunies</i>, to the Scottish Gipsies. At
one period they seem to have exercised a sort of sovereign
authority in the tribe, over almost the whole of Scotland;
and, according to the ordinary practice of writing history of
a great deal more importance, they should, as the chief family
of a tribe, be particularly noticed.</p>

<p>The quarrels of the Gipsies frequently broke out in an
instant, and almost without a visible cause. A farmer&#8217;s
wife, with whom I was acquainted, was one day sitting in
the midst of a band of them, at work in an old out-house, enquiring
the news of the country of them, when, in an instant,
a shower of horns and hammers, open knives, files,
and fiery peats, were flying through the house, at one another&#8217;s
heads. The good-wife took to her heels immediately,
to get out of the fray. Some of their conflicts were terrible
in the extreme. Dr. Pennecuik, in his history of Peebles-shire,
already <a href="#Page_185">referred to</a>, gives an account of a sanguinary
struggle that took place on his estate of Romanno, in Tweed-dale.
The following are the particulars in his own words:</p>

<p>&#8220;Upon the 1st of October, 1677, there happened at Romanno,
on the very spot where now the dove-cot is built, a
remarkable polymachy betwixt two clans of Gipsies, the
Fawes and the Shawes, who had come from Haddington fair,
and were going to Harestanes, to meet two other clans of
these rogues, the Baillies and Browns, with a resolution to
fight them. They fell out, at Romanno, among themselves,
about dividing the spoil they had got at Haddington, and
fought it manfully. Of the Fawes, there were four brethren
and a brother&#8217;s son; of the Shawes, the father with three
sons; and several women on both sides. Old Sandie Fawe,
a bold and proper fellow,<a name="FNanchor123" id="FNanchor123"></a><a href="#Footnote123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> with his wife, then with child,
were both killed dead upon the place; and his brother
George very dangerously wounded. In February, 1678, old
Robin Shawe, the Gipsy, and his three sons, were hanged
at the Grass-market, for the above-mentioned murder, committed
at Romanno; and John Fawe was hanged, the Wednesday
following, for another murder. Sir Archibald Primrose
was justice general at the time, and Sir George
McKenzie king&#8217;s advocate.&#8221; Contrasting the obstinate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
ferocity of the Gipsy with the harmless and innocent nature
of the dove, Dr. Pennecuik erected on the spot a dove-cot;
and, to commemorate the battle, placed upon the lintel of
the door the following inscription:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">&#8220;A. D. 1683.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The field of Gipsie blood, which here you see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shelter for the harmless dove shall be.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This Gipsy battle is also noticed by Lord Fountainhall, in
the following extract from his MS., now in the Advocate&#8217;s
Library:&mdash;&#8220;Sixth February, 1678.&mdash;Four Egyptians, of the
name of Shaw, were this day hanged&mdash;the father and three
sons&mdash;for the slaughter committed by them on the Faws,
(another tribe of these vagabonds, worse than the mendicants
validi, mentioned in the code,) in a drunken squabble,
made by them in a rendezvous they had at Romanno, with a
design to unite their forces against the clans of Browns and
Bailezies (Baillies), that were come over from Ireland,<a name="FNanchor124" id="FNanchor124"></a><a href="#Footnote124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> to
chase them back again, that they might not share in their
labours; but, in their ramble, they discovered and committed
the foresaid murder; and sundry of them, of both sides,
were apprehended.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;The four being thrown into a hole
dug for them in the Greyfriars churchyard, with their
clothes on, the next morning the body of the youngest of
the three sons, (who was scarce sixteen,) was missed. Some
thought that, being last thrown over the ladder, and first
cut down, and in full vigour, and not much earth placed upon
him, and lying uppermost, and so not so ready to smother,
the fermentation of the blood, and heat of the bodies under
him, might cause him to rebound, and throw off the earth,
and recover ere the morning, and steal away. Which, if
true, he deserved his life, though the magistrates deserved a
reprimand. But others, more probably, thought his body
was stolen away by some chirurgeon, or his servant, to make
an anatomical dissection on.&#8221;</p>

<p>About a century after this conflict, we find the nature of
the Gipsies still unchanged. The following details of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
of their general engagements will serve as a specimen of
the obstinate and desperate manner in which, to a late
period, they fought among themselves. The battle took
place at the bridge of Hawick, in the spring of the year
1772, or 1773. The particulars are derived from the late
Mr. Robert Laidlaw, Tenant of Fanash, a gentleman of
respectability, who was an eye-witness to the scene of action.
It was understood that this battle originated in some encroachments
of the one tribe upon the district assigned to
the other; a principal source of quarrels among these wanderers.
And it was agreed to, by the contending parties,
that they were to fight out their dispute the first time they
should meet, which, as just said, happened at Hawick.</p>

<p>On the one side, in this battle, was the celebrated Alexander
Kennedy, a handsome and athletic man, and head of
his tribe. Next to him, in consideration, was little Wull
Ruthven, Kennedy&#8217;s father-in-law. This man was known, all
over the country, by the extraordinary title of the Earl of
Hell;<a name="FNanchor125" id="FNanchor125"></a><a href="#Footnote125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> and, although he was above five feet ten inches in
height, he got the appellation of Little Wull, to distinguish
him from Muckle William Ruthven, who was a man of uncommon
stature and personal strength.<a name="FNanchor126" id="FNanchor126"></a><a href="#Footnote126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> The earl&#8217;s son was
also in the fray. These were the chief men in Kennedy&#8217;s
band. Jean Ruthven, Kennedy&#8217;s wife, was also present;
with a great number of inferior members of the clan, males
as well as females, of all ages, down to mere children. The
opposite band consisted of old Rob Tait, the chieftain of his
horde, Jacob Tait, young Rob Tait, and three of old Rob
Tait&#8217;s sons-in-law. These individuals, with Jean Gordon,
old Tait&#8217;s wife, and a numerous train, of youths of both
sexes and various ages, composed the adherents of old Robert
Tait. These adverse tribes were all closely connected
with one another by the ties of blood. The Kennedys and
Ruthvens were from the ancient burgh of Lochmaben.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>The whole of the Gipsies in the field, females as well as
males, were armed with bludgeons, excepting some of the
Taits, who carried cutlasses, and pieces of iron hoops,
notched and serrated on either side, like a saw, and fixed to
the end of sticks. The boldest of the tribe were in front
of their respective bands, with their children and the other
members of their clan in the rear, forming a long train behind
them. In this order both parties boldly advanced, with
their weapons uplifted above their heads. Both sides fought
with extraordinary fury and obstinacy. Sometimes the one
band gave way, and sometimes the other; but both, again
and again, returned to the combat with fresh ardour. Not
a word was spoken during the struggle; nothing was heard
but the rattling of the cudgels and the strokes of the cutlasses.
After a long and doubtful contest, Jean Ruthven,
big with child at the time, at last received, among many
other blows, a dreadful wound with a cutlass. She was cut
to the bone, above and below the breast, particularly on one
side. It was said the slashes were so large and deep that
one of her breasts was nearly severed from her body, and
that the motions of her lungs, while she breathed, were observed
through the aperture between her ribs. But, notwithstanding
her dreadful condition, she would neither quit the
field nor yield, but continued to assist her husband as long
as she was able. Her father, the Earl of Hell, was also
shockingly wounded; the flesh being literally cut from the
bone of one of his legs, and, in the words of my informant,
&#8220;hanging down over his ankles, like beef steaks.&#8221; The earl
left the field to get his wounds dressed; but observing his
daughter, Kennedy&#8217;s wife, so dangerously wounded, he lost
heart, and, with others of his party, fled, leaving Kennedy
alone, to defend himself against the whole of the clan of
Tait.</p>

<p>Having now all the Taits, young and old, male and female,
to contend with, Kennedy, like an experienced warrior,
took advantage of the local situation of the place. Posting
himself on the narrow bridge of Hawick, he defended
himself in the defile, with his bludgeon, against the whole
of his infuriated enemies. His handsome person, his undaunted
bravery, his extraordinary dexterity in handling
his weapon, and his desperate situation, (for it was evident
to all that the Taits thirsted for his blood, and were determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
to despatch him on the spot,) excited a general and
lively interest in his favour, among the inhabitants of the
town, who were present, and had witnessed the conflict with
amazement and horror. In one dash to the front, and with
one powerful sweep of his cudgel, he disarmed two of the
Taits, and cutting a third to the skull, felled him to the
ground. He sometimes daringly advanced upon his assailants,
and drove the whole band before him, pell-mell. When
he broke one cudgel on his enemies, by his powerful arm,
the town&#8217;s people were ready to hand him another. Still,
the vindictive Taits rallied, and renewed the charge with
unabated vigour; and every one present expected that Kennedy
would fall a sacrifice to their desperate fury. A party
of messengers and constables at last arrived to his relief,
when the Taits were all apprehended, and imprisoned; but,
as none of the Gipsies were actually slain in the fray, they
were soon set at liberty.<a name="FNanchor127" id="FNanchor127"></a><a href="#Footnote127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>In this battle, it was said that every Gipsy, except Alexander
Kennedy, the brave chief, was severely wounded;
and that the ground on which they fought was wet with
blood. Jean Gordon, however, stole, unobserved, from her
band, and, taking a circuitous road, came behind Kennedy,
and struck him on the head with her cudgel. What astonished
the inhabitants of Hawick the most of all, was the
fierce and stubborn disposition of the Gipsy females. It
was remarked that, when they were knocked down senseless
to the ground, they rose again, with redoubled vigour and
energy, to the combat. This unconquerable obstinacy and
courage of their females is held in high estimation by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
tribe. I once heard a Gipsy sing a song, which celebrated
one of their battles; and, in it, the brave and determined
manner in which the girls bore the blows of the cudgel over
their heads was particularly applauded.</p>

<p>The battle at Hawick was not decisive to either party.
The hostile bands, a short time afterwards, came in contact,
in Ettrick Forest, at a place, on the water of Teema, called
Deephope. They did not, however, engage here; but the
females on both sides, at some distance from one another,
with a stream between them, scolded and cursed, and, clapping
their hands, urged the males again to fight. The men,
however, more cautious, only observed a sullen and gloomy
silence at this meeting. Probably both parties, from experience,
were unwilling to renew the fight, being aware of
the consequences which would follow, should they again
close in battle. The two clans then separated, each taking
different roads, but both keeping possession of the disputed
district. In the course of a few days, they again met in
Eskdale moor, when a second desperate conflict ensued.
The Taits were here completely routed, and driven from
the district, in which they had attempted to travel by force.</p>

<p>The country-people were horrified at the sight of the
wounded Tinklers, after these sanguinary engagements.
Several of them, lame and exhausted, in consequence of the
severity of their numerous wounds, were, by the assistance
of their tribe, carried through the country on the backs of
asses; so much were they cut up in their persons. Some of
them, it was said, were slain outright, and never more heard
of. Jean Ruthven, however, who was so dreadfully slashed,
recovered from her wounds, to the surprise of all who had
seen her mangled body, which was sewed in different parts
by her clan. These battles were talked of for thirty miles
around the country. I have heard old people speak of them,
with fear and wonder at the fierce, unyielding disposition
of the willful and vindictive Tinklers.<a name="FNanchor128" id="FNanchor128"></a><a href="#Footnote128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>We have already seen that the female Gipsies are nearly
as expert at handling the cudgel, and fully as fierce and unyielding
in their quarrels and conflicts, as the males of their
race. The following particulars relative to a Gipsy scuffle,
derived from an eye-witness, will illustrate how a Gipsy woman,
of the name of Rebecca Keith, displayed no little dexterity
in the effective use which she made of her bludgeon.</p>

<p>Two gangs of Gipsies, of different tribes, had taken up
their quarters, on a Saturday, the one at the town of Dumblane,
the other at a farm-steading on the estate of Cromlix,
in the neighbourhood. On the Sunday following, the Dumblane
horde paid a visit to the others, at their country
quarters. The place set apart for their accommodation was
an old kiln, of which they had possession, where they were
feasted with abundance of savoury viands, and regaled with
mountain dew, in copious libations, of quality fit for a prince.
The country squad were of the Keith fraternity, and their
queen, or head personage, at the time, was Rebecca Keith,
past the middle age, but of gigantic stature, and great muscular
power. In the course of their carousal, a quarrel
ensued between the two gangs, and a fierce battle followed.
The Keiths were the weaker party, but Becca, as she was
called by the country people, performed prodigies of valour,
against fearful odds, with only the aid of her strong, hard-worn
shoe, which she wielded with the dexterity and effect
of an experienced cudgelist. She appeared, however, unable
much longer to contend against her too numerous opponents.
Being a great favourite with all, especially with the inmates
of the farm which was the scene of encounter, two young
boys&mdash;the informant and the herd-callant&mdash;who witnessed
the engagement, and whose sympathy was altogether on the
side of the valourous Becca, exchanged a hurried and whispering
remark to each other that, &#8220;if she had the <i>soople</i> of
a flail, they thought she would do gude wark.&#8221; No sooner
said than done. The herd-boy went off at once to the barn,
cut the thongs asunder, and returned, in a twinkling, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the soople below his jacket, concealing it from view, with the
cunning of a thief. Edging up to Becca, and uncovering the
end of the weapon, it was seized upon by her with avidity.
She flourished it in the air, and plied it with such effect,
about the ears of her adversaries, that they were speedily
driven off the field, with &#8220;sarks full of sore bones.&#8221; In this
furious manner would the friendly meetings of the Gipsies
frequently terminate.<a name="FNanchor129" id="FNanchor129"></a><a href="#Footnote129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>So formidable were the numbers of the nomadic Gipsies,
at one time, and so alarming their desperate and sanguinary
battles, in the upper parts of Tweed-dale and Clydesdale,
that the fencible men in their neighbourhood, (the <i>country-side</i>
was the expression,) had sometimes to turn out to quell
and disperse them. A clergyman was, on one occasion, under
the necessity of dismissing his congregation, in the
middle of divine service, that they might quell one of these
furious Gipsy tumults, in the immediate vicinity of the
church.<a name="FNanchor130" id="FNanchor130"></a><a href="#Footnote130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>About the year 1770, the mother of the Baillies received
some personal injury, or rather insult, at a fair at Biggar,
from a gardener of the name of John Cree. The insult was
instantly resented by the Gipsies; but Cree was luckily
protected by his friends. In contempt and defiance of the
whole multitude in the market, four of the Baillies&mdash;Matthew,
James, William, and John&mdash;all brothers, appeared on
horse-back, dressed in scarlet, and armed with broad-swords,
and, parading through the crowd, threatened to be
avenged of the gardener, and those who had assisted him.
Burning with revenge, they threw off their coats, rolled up
the sleeves of their shirts to the shoulder, like butchers when
at work, and, with their naked and brawny arms, and glittering
swords in their clenched hands, furiously rode up and
down the fair, threatening death to all who should oppose
them. Their bare arms, naked weapons, and resolute looks,
showed that they were prepared to slaughter their enemies
without mercy. No one dared to interfere with them, till
the minister of the parish appeased their rage, and persuaded
them to deliver up their swords. It was found absolutely
necessary, however, to keep a watch upon the gardener&#8217;s
house, for six months after the occurrence, to protect him
and his family from the vengeance of the vindictive Gipsies.</p>

<p>To bring into view and illustrate the character and practices
of our Scottish Gipsies, I will transcribe the following details,
in the original words, from a MS. which I received
from the late Mr. Blackwood, as a contribution towards a
history of the Gipsies. Mr. Blackwood did not say who the
writer of the paper was, but some one mentioned to me that
he was a clergyman. I am satisfied that the statements it
contains are true, and that the William Baillie therein mentioned
was, in his day and generation, well known, over the
greater part of Scotland, as chief of his tribe within the
kingdom. He was the grandfather of the four Gipsies who,
as just mentioned, set at defiance the whole multitude at
Biggar fair. It will be seen, by this MS., that while the
principal Gipsies, with their subordinates, were plundering
the public, in all directions, they sometimes performed acts
of gratitude and great kindness to their favourites of the
community among whom they travelled. In it will also be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
exhibited the cool and business-like manner in which they
delivered back stolen purses, when circumstances rendered
such restoration necessary.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was formerly a gang of Gipsies, or pick-pockets,
who used to frequent the fairs in Dumfries-shire, headed by
a William Baillie, or Will Baillie, as the country-people
were accustomed to call him, of whom the old men used to
tell many stories.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before any considerable fair, if the gang were at a distance
from the place where it was to be held, whoever of
them were appointed to go, went singly, or, at most, never
above two travelled together. A day or so after, Mr. Baillie
himself followed, mounted like a nobleman; and, as journeys,
in those days, were almost all performed on horseback, he
sometimes rode, for many miles, with gentlemen of the first
respectability in the country. And, as he could discourse
readily and fluently on almost any topic, he was often taken
to be some country gentleman of property, as his dress and
manners seemed to indicate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Once, in a very crowded fair at Dumfries, an honest farmer,
from the parish of Hatton, in Annandale, had his pocket
picked of a considerable sum, in gold, with which he was
going to buy cattle. On discovering his loss, he immediately
went and got a purse like the one he had lost, into which he
put a good number of small stones, and, going into a crowded
part of the fair, he kept a watchful eye on his pocket, and, in
a little while, he caught a fellow in the very act of picking
it. The farmer, who was a stout, athletic man, did not wish
to make any noise, as he knew a more ready way of recovering
his money; but whispered to the fellow, while he still
kept fast hold of him, to come out of the throng a little, as
he wanted to speak to him. There he told him that he had
lost his money, and that, if he would get it to him again, he
would let him go; if not, he would have him put in jail immediately.
The pick-pocket desired him to come along with
him, and he would see what could be done, the farmer still
keeping close to him, lest he should escape. They entered
an obscure house, in an unfrequented close, where they found
Mr. Baillie sitting. The farmer told his tale, concluding
with a promise that, as the loss of the money would hurt
him very much, he would, if he could get it back again,
make no more ado about it. On which, Mr. Baillie went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
a concealment in the wall, and brought out the very purse
the farmer had lost, with the contents untouched, which he
returned to the farmer, who received it with much gratitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;The farmer, after doing his business in the fair, got a
little intoxicated in the evening; on which he thought he
would call on Mr. Baillie, and give him a treat, for his kindness
in restoring his purse; but on entering the house, the
woman who kept it, a poor widow, fell on him and abused
him sadly, asking him what he had done to cause Mr.
Stewart, by which name she knew Mr. Baillie, to leave her
house; and saying she had lost the best friend that ever she
had, for always when he stayed a day or two in her house,
(which he used to do twice a year,) he gave her as much as
paid her half-year&#8217;s rent; but after he, (the farmer,) called
that day, Mr. Stewart, she said, left her house, telling her he
could not stay with her any longer; but before he went, she
said, he had given her what was to pay her half-year&#8217;s rent,
a resource, she lamented, she would lose in future. About
two years afterwards, the farmer again had the curiosity to
call on her, and ask her if her lodger had ever returned.
She said he never had, but that, ever since, a stranger had
called regularly, and given her money to pay her rent.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the parish of Kirkmichael, about eight miles from
Dumfries, lived a widow who occupied a small farm. As
she had a number of young children, and no man to assist
her, she fell behind in paying her rent, and at last got a
summons of removal. She had a kiln that stood at a considerable
distance from the other houses, which was much
frequented by Baillie&#8217;s people, when they came that way;
and she gave them, at all times, peaceable possession, as she
had no person to contend with them, or put them away, and
she herself did not wish to differ with them. They, on the
other hand, never molested anything she had. One evening,
a number of them arrived rather late, and went into the
kiln, as usual; after which, one came into the house, to ask
a few peats, to make a fire. She gave the peats, saying she
believed they would soon have to shift their quarters, as she
herself was warned to flit, and she did not know if the next
tenant would allow them such quiet possession, and she did
not know what would become of herself and her helpless
family. Nothing more was said, but, after having put her
children to bed, as she was sitting by the fire, in a disconsolate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
manner, she heard a gentle tap at the door. On opening
it, a genteel, well-dressed man entered, who told her he
just wished to speak with her for a few minutes, and, sitting
down, said he had heard she was warned to remove, and
asked how much she was behind. She told him exactly.
On which, rising hastily, he slipt a purse into her hand, and
went out before she could say a single word.</p>

<p>&#8220;The widow, however, kept the farm, paid off all old
debts, and brought up her family decently; but still, it
grieved her that she did not know who was her benefactor.
She never told any person till about ten years afterwards,
when she told a friend who came to see her, when she
was rather poorly in health. After hearing the story, he
asked her what sort of a man he was who gave her the
money. She said their interview was so short, and it was
so long past, that she could recollect little of him, but only
remembered well that he had the scar of a cut across his
nose. On which, her friend immediately exclaimed, &#8216;Then
Will Baillie was the man.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Before the year 1740, the roads were bad through all
the country. Carts were not then in use, and all the merchants&#8217;
goods were conveyed in packs, on horseback.
Among others, the farmers on the water of Ae, in Dumfries-shire,
were almost all pack-carriers. As there was little
improvement of land then, they had little to do at home,
and so they made their rents mostly by carrying. Among
others, there was an uncle of my father, whose name was
Robert McVitie, who used to be a great carrier. This man,
once, in returning from Edinburgh, stopt at Broughton, and
in coming out of the stable, he met a man, who asked him
if he knew him. Robert, after looking at him for a little,
said: &#8216;I think you are Mr. Baillie.&#8217; He said, I am, and
asked if Robert could lend him two guineas, and it should
be faithfully repaid. As there were few people who wished
to differ with Baillie, Robert told him he was welcome to
two guineas, or more if he wanted it. He said that would
just do; on which Robert gave them to him, and he put them
into his pocket. Baillie then asked, if ever he was molested
by any person, when he was travelling late with his packs.
He said he never was, although he was sometimes a little
afraid. Baillie then gave him a kind of brass token, about
the size of a half-crown, with some marks upon it, which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
desired him to carry in his purse, and it might be of use
to him some time, as he was to show it, if any person offered
to rob him. Baillie then mounted his horse and rode off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some considerable time after this, as Robert was one
evening travelling with his packs, between Elvanfoot and
Moffat, two men came up to him, whom he thought very
suspicious-looking fellows. As he was a stout man himself,
and carried a good cudgel, he kept on the alert for a considerable
way, lest they should take him by surprise. At
last, one of them asked him if he was not afraid to travel
alone, so late at night. He said he was under a necessity
to be out late, sometimes, on his lawful business. But recollecting
his token, he said a gentleman had once given him
a piece of brass, to show, if ever any person troubled him.
They desired him to show it, as it was moonlight. He gave
it to them. On seeing it, they looked at one another, and
then, whispering a few words, told him it was well for him
he had the token, which they returned; and they left him
directly.</p>

<p>&#8220;After a lapse of nearly two years, when he had almost
forgotten his two guineas, as he was one morning loading
his packs, at the door of a public-house, near Gretna-green,
he felt some person touch him behind, and, on looking
round, saw it was Mr. Baillie, who slipped something into
his hand, wrapped in paper, and left him, without speaking
a single word. On opening the paper, he found three
guineas, which was his own money, and a guinea for interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was another gang of Gipsies that stayed mostly
in Annandale, headed by a Jock Johnstone, as he was called
in the country. These were counted a kind of lower caste
than Baillie&#8217;s people, who would have thought themselves
degraded if they had associated with any of the Johnstone
gang. Johnstone confined his travels mostly to Dumfries-shire;
while Baillie went over all Scotland, and even made
long excursions into England. Johnstone kept a great
many women about him,<a name="FNanchor131" id="FNanchor131"></a><a href="#Footnote131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> several of whom had children to
him; and, in kilns and in barns, Johnstone always slept in
the middle of the whole gang. Baillie sometimes told his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
select friends that he had a wife, but never any of them
could find out where she stayed; and as he used to disappear
now and then, for a considerable time together, it was
supposed he was with her. He never slept, in barn or kiln,
with any of his people. Johnstone travelled all day in the
midst of a crowd of women and children, mounted on asses.
Baillie travelled always by himself, mounted on the best
horse he could get for money.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some time in the year 1739, Johnstone, with a number of
his women, came to the house of one Margaret Farish, an
old woman who sold ale at Lonegate, six miles from Dumfries,
on the Edinburgh road. After drinking for a long
time, some of Jock&#8217;s wives and the old woman quarrelled.
On which he took up the pewter pint-stoup, with which she
measured her ale, and, giving her two or three severe blows
on the head, killed her on the spot. Next day he was apprehended
near Lockerby, and brought into Dumfries&#8217; jail.
He had a favourite tame jack-daw that he took with him in
all his travels, and he desired it might be brought to stay
with him in the jail, which was done. When the lords were
coming into the circuit, as they passed the jail, the trumpeters
gave a blast, on which the jack-daw gave a flutter
against the iron bars of the window, and dropped down dead.
When Jock saw that, he immediately exclaimed: &#8216;Lord
have mercy on me, for I am gone.&#8217; He was accordingly
tried and condemned. When the day of execution came, he
would not walk to the scaffold, and so they were forced to
carry him. The executioner, being an old man, could not
turn him over. Several of the constables refused to touch
him. At last, one of the burgh officers turned him off; but
the old people about Dumfries used to say that the officer
never prospered any more after that day.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor132" id="FNanchor132"></a><a href="#Footnote132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>The extraordinary man Baillie, who is here so often mentioned,
was well known in Tweed-dale and Clydesdale; and
my great-grandfather, who knew him well, used to say that
he was the handsomest, the best dressed, the best looking,
and the best bred man he ever saw. As I have already
mentioned, he generally rode one of the best horses the
kingdom could produce; himself attired in the finest scarlet,
with his greyhounds following him, as if he had been a
man of the first rank. With the usual Gipsy policy, he represented
himself as a bastard son of one of the Baillies of
Lamington, his mother being a Gipsy. On this account, considerable
attention was paid to him by the country-people;
indeed, he was taken notice of by the first in the land. But,
from his singular habits, his real character at last became
well known. He acted the character of the gentleman, the
robber, the sorner, and the tinker, whenever it answered
his purpose. He was considered, in his time, the best
swordsman in all Scotland. With this weapon in his hand,
and his back at a wall, he set almost everything, saving fire-arms,
at defiance. His sword is still preserved by his
descendants, as a relic of their powerful ancestor. The
stories that are told of this splendid Gipsy are numerous and
interesting. I will relate only two well-authenticated anecdotes
of this <i>baurie rajah</i>, this king of the Scottish Gipsies;
who was, in all probability, a descendant of Towla Bailyow,
who, with other Gipsies, rebelled against, and plundered,
John Faw, &#8220;Lord and Earl of Little Egypt,&#8221; in the reign of
James V. The following transaction of his has some resemblance
to a custom among the Arabians.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>William, with his numerous horde, happened to fall in
with a travelling packman, on a wild spot between Hawkshaw
and Menzion, near the source of the Tweed. The packman
was immediately commanded to halt, and lay his packs
upon the ground. Baillie then unsheathed his broadsword,
with which he was always armed, and, with the point of the
weapon, drew, on the ground, a circle around the trembling
packman and his wares. Within this circle no one of the
tribe was allowed by him to enter but himself.<a name="FNanchor133" id="FNanchor133"></a><a href="#Footnote133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> The poor
man was now ordered to unbuckle his packs, and exhibit his
merchandise to the Gipsies. Baillie, without the least ceremony,
helped himself to some of the most valuable things in
the pack, and gave a great many to the members of his band.
The unfortunate merchant, well aware of the character of
his customers, concluded himself a ruined man; and, in place
of making any resistance, handed away his property to the
Gipsies. But when they were satisfied, he was most agreeably
surprised by Baillie taking out his purse, and paying
him, on the spot, a great deal more than the value of every
article he had taken for himself and given to his band. The
delighted packman failed not to extol, wherever he went,
the gentlemanly conduct and extraordinary liberality of
&#8220;Captain Baillie&#8221;&mdash;a title by which he was known all over
the country.</p>

<p>The perilous situations in which Baillie was often placed
did not repress the merry jocularity and sarcastic wit which
he, in common with many of his tribe, possessed. He sometimes
almost bearded and insulted the judge while sitting on the
bench. On one of these occasions, when he was in court,
the judge, provoked at seeing him so often at the bar, observed
to him that he would assuredly get his ears cut out
of his head, if he did not mend his manners, and abandon
his way of life. &#8220;That I defy you to do, my lord,&#8221; replied
the Tinkler. The judge, perceiving that his ears had already
been &#8220;nailed to the tron, and cut off,&#8221; and being displeased
at the effrontery and levity of his conduct, told him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
that he was certainly a great villain. &#8220;I am not such a
villain as your lordship,&#8221; retorted Baillie. &#8220;What do you
say?&#8221; rejoined the judge, in great surprise at the bold manner
of the criminal. &#8220;I say,&#8221; continued the Gipsy, &#8220;that I
am not such a villain as your lordship &mdash;&mdash; takes me to be.&#8221;
&#8220;William,&#8221; quoth the judge, &#8220;put your words closer together,
otherwise you shall have cause to repent of your insolence
and audacity.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor134" id="FNanchor134"></a><a href="#Footnote134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>Tradition states that William Baillie&#8217;s conduct involved
him in numerous scrapes. He was brought before the Justiciary
Court, and had &#8220;his ears nailed to the tron, or other
tree, and cut off, and banished the country,&#8221; for his many
crimes of &#8220;sorning, pickery, and little thieving.&#8221; It also
appears, from popular tradition, that he is the same William
Baillie who is repeatedly noticed by Hume and McLaurin,
in their remarks on the criminal law of Scotland.</p>

<p>In June, 1699, William Baillie, for being an Egyptian, and
for forging and using a forged pass, was sentenced to be
&#8220;hanged; but the privy council commuted his sentence to
banishment, but under the express condition that, if ever he
returned to this country, the former sentence should be executed
against him.&#8221; William entered into a bond with the
privy council, under the penalty of 500 merks, to leave the
kingdom, and to &#8220;suffer the pains of death, in case of contravention
thereof.&#8221;</p>

<p>This Gipsy chief paid little regard to the terrible conditions
of his bond, in case of failure; for, on the 10th and 11th August,
1714, &#8220;Baillie,&#8221; says Hume, &#8220;and two of his associates,
were convicted and condemned to die; but as far as concerned
Baillie, (for the others were executed,) his doom was
afterwards mitigated into transportation, under pain of death
in case of return.&#8221; &#8220;The jury,&#8221; says McLaurin, &#8220;brought
in a special verdict as to the sorning,<a name="FNanchor135" id="FNanchor135"></a><a href="#Footnote135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> but said nothing at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
all as to any other points; all they found proved was, that
William, in March, 1713, had taken possession of a barn,
without consent of the owner, and that, during his abode in
it, there was corn taken out of the barn, and he went away
without paying anything for his quarters, or for any corn
during his abode, which was for several days; and that he
was habit and repute an Egyptian, and did wear a pistol<a name="FNanchor136" id="FNanchor136"></a><a href="#Footnote136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
and shable,&#8221; (a kind of sabre.)</p>

<p>&#8220;As early as the month of August, 1715, the same man,
as I understand it,&#8221; says Baron Hume, &#8220;was again indicted,
not only for being found in Britain, but for continuing his
former practices and course of life. Notwithstanding this
aggravation, the interlocutor is again framed on the indulgent
plan; and only infers the pain of death from the fame
and character of being an Egyptian, joined with various acts
of violence and sorning, to the number of three that are
stated in the libel. Though convicted nearly to the extent
of the interlocutor, he again escaped with transportation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Baillie&#8217;s policy in representing himself as a bastard son of
an ancient and honourable family had, as I have already observed,
been of great service to him; and in no way would
it be more so than in his various trials. It is almost certain,
as in cases of more recent times, that great interest would
be used to save a bastard branch of an honourable house
from an ignominious death upon the scaffold, when his crimes
amounted only to &#8220;sorning, pickery, and little thieving, and
habit and repute an Egyptian.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor137" id="FNanchor137"></a><a href="#Footnote137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>The descendants of William Baillie state that he was
married to a woman of the name of Rachel Johnstone; and
that he was killed, in a scuffle, by a Gipsy of the name of
Pinkerton, in a quarrel among themselves. Baillie being
quite superior in personal strength to Pinkerton, his wife
took hold of him, for fear of his destroying his opponent,
and, while he was in her arms, Pinkerton ran him through
with his sword. Upon his death, his son, then a youth of
thirteen years of age, took a solemn oath, on the spot, that
he would never rest until the blood of his father should be
avenged. And, true to his oath, his mother and himself followed
the track of the murderer over Scotland, England,
and Ireland, like staunch bloodhounds, and rested not, till
Pinkerton was apprehended, tried, and executed.</p>

<p>The following particulars, relative to the slaughter of William
Baillie, were published in Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine, but
apparently without any knowledge, on the part of the writer,
of that individual&#8217;s history, further than that he was a
Gipsy.</p>

<p>&#8220;In a precognition, taken in March, 1725, by Sir James
Stewart, of Coltness, and Captain Lockhart, of Kirkton, two
of his majesty&#8217;s justices of the peace for Lanarkshire, anent
the murder of William Baillie, brazier,<a name="FNanchor138" id="FNanchor138"></a><a href="#Footnote138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> commonly called
Gipsy, the following evidence is adduced:&mdash;John Meikle,
wright, declares, that, upon the twelfth of November last, he,
being in the house of Thomas Riddle, in Newarthill, with
some others, the deceased, William Baillie, James Kairns,
and David Pinkerton, were in another room, drinking, where,
after some high words, and a confused noise and squabble,
the said three persons, above-named, went all out; and the
declarant, knowing them to be three of those idle sorners
that pass in the country under the name of Gipsies, in hopes
they were gone off, rose, and went to the door, to take the
air; where, to his surprise, he saw William Baillie standing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
and Kairns and Pinkerton on horseback, with drawn swords
in their hands, who both rushed upon the said William Baillie,
and struck him with their swords; whereupon, the said
William Baillie fell down, crying out he was gone; upon
which, Kairns and Pinkerton rode off: That the declarant
helped to carry the said William Baillie into the house,
where, upon search, he was found to have a great cut or
wound on his head, and a wound in his body, just below the
slot of his breast: And declares, he, the said William Baillie,
died some time after.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thomas Riddle, tenant and change-keeper in Newarthill,
&amp;c., declares, that the deceased, William Baillie, James
Kairns, and David Pinkerton, all idle sorners, that are
known in the country by the name of Gipsies, came to the
declarant&#8217;s, about sun-setting, where, after some stay, <i>and
talking a jargon the declarant did not well understand</i>, they
fell a squabbling, when the declarant was in another room,
with some other company; upon the noise of which, the declarant
ran in to them, where he found the said James Kairns
lying above the said William Baillie, whose nose the said
James Kairns had bitten with his teeth till it bled; upon
which, the declarant and his wife threatened to raise the
town upon them, and get a constable to carry them to
prison; but Kairns and Pinkerton called for their horses,
William Baillie saying he would not go with them: Declares
that, after the said Kairns and Pinkerton had got their
horses, and mounted, they ordered the declarant to bring a
chopin of ale to the door to them, where William Baillie was
standing, talking to them: That, when the declarant had filled
about the ale, and left them, thinking they were going off,
the declarant&#8217;s wife went to the door, where Kairns struck
at her with a drawn sword, to fright her in; upon which
she ran in; and thereupon the declarant went to the door,
where he found the said William Baillie, lying with the
wounds upon him, mentioned in John Meikle&#8217;s declaration.&#8221;</p>

<p>By Hume&#8217;s work on the criminal law, it appears that the
trial of David Pinkerton, with others of his tribe, took place
on the 22nd August, 1726, for &#8220;sorning and robbery;&#8221; but
no mention is made of the murder of Baillie; yet it was
Baillie&#8217;s relatives that pursued Pinkerton to the gallows.
Probably sufficient evidence could not then be adduced to
substantiate the fact, being about twenty-one months after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the murder was committed; and, besides, Baillie was himself
dead in law, having either returned from banishment, or
remained at large in the country, and so forfeited his life,
when he was killed by Pinkerton, in 1724. The following
is part of the interlocutor pronounced upon the indictment
of the prisoners: &#8220;Find the said David Pinkerton, alias Maxwell,
John Marshall, and Helen Baillie, alias Douglass, or
any of them, their being habit and repute Egyptians, sorners
or masterful beggars, in conjunction with said pannels, or
any of them, their being, at the times and places libelled,
guilty, art and part, of the fact of violence, theft, robbery, or
attempts of robbery libelled, or any of the said facts relevant
to infer the pain of death and confiscation of moveables.&#8221;</p>

<p>William Baillie was succeeded, in the chieftainship, by
his son Matthew, who married the celebrated Mary Yowston
or Yorkston, and became the leader of a powerful horde of
Gipsies in the south of Scotland. He frequently visited the
farms of my grandfather, about the year 1770. It appears
that his courtship had been after the Tartar manner; for he
used to say that the toughest battle he ever fought was
that of taking, by force, his bride, then a very young girl,
from her mother, at the hamlet of Drummelzier.<a name="FNanchor139" id="FNanchor139"></a><a href="#Footnote139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> This
Matthew Baillie had, by Mary Yorkston, a son, who was
also named Matthew, and who married Margaret Campbell,
and had by her a family of remarkably handsome and pretty
daughters. Of this principal Gipsy family, I can trace,
distinctly, six generations in descent, and have myself seen
the great-great-great-grand-children of the celebrated William
Baillie. Some of his descendants still travel the country,
in the manner of their ancestors, and at this moment
speak the Gipsy language with fluency. Some of them,
however, are little better than common beggars. There
were, at one period, a captain and a quarter-master in the
army, belonging to the Baillie clan; and another was a
country surgeon.</p>

<p>Mary Yorkston, above mentioned, went under the appellations
of &#8220;my lady,&#8221; and &#8220;the duchess,&#8221; and bore the title of
queen, among her tribe. She presided at the celebration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
their barbarous marriages, and assisted at their equally
singular ceremonies of divorce. What the custom of this
queen of the Gipsies was, when in full dress, in her youth,
on gala days, cannot now be easily known; but the following
is a description of her masculine figure, and <i>public</i> travelling
apparel, when advanced in years. It was taken from the
mouth of an aged and very respectable gentleman, the late
Mr. David Stoddart, at Bankhead, near Queensferry, who
had often seen her in his youth: She was fully six feet in
stature, stout made in her person, with very strongly-marked
and harsh features; and had, altogether, a very imposing
aspect and manner. She wore a large black beaver-hat,
tied down over her ears with a handkerchief, knotted below
her chin, in the Gipsy fashion. Her upper garment was a
dark-blue short cloak, somewhat after the Spanish fashion,
made of substantial woollen cloth, approaching to superfine
in quality. The greater part of her other apparel was made
of dark-blue camlet cloth, with petticoats so short that they
scarcely reached to the calves of her well-set legs. [Indeed,
all the females among the Baillies wore petticoats of the
same length.] Her stockings were of dark-blue worsted,
flowered and ornamented at the ankles with scarlet thread;
and in her shoes she displayed large, massy, silver buckles.
The whole of her habiliments were very substantial, with
not a rag or rent to be seen about her person. [She was
sometimes dressed in a green gown, trimmed with red
ribbons.] Her outer petticoat was folded up round her
haunches, for a lap, with a large pocket dangling at each
side; and below her cloak she carried, between her shoulders,
a small flat pack, or pad, which contained her most
valuable articles. About her person she generally kept a
large clasp-knife, with a long, broad blade, resembling a dagger
or carving-knife; and carried in her hand a long pole
or pike-staff, that reached about a foot above her head.</p>

<p>It was a common practice, about the middle of last century,
for old female Gipsies of authority to strip, without
hesitation, defenceless individuals of their wearing-apparel
when they met them in sequestered places. Mary Yorkston
chanced, on one occasion, to meet a shepherd&#8217;s wife,
among the wild hills in the parish of Stobo, and stripped her
of the whole of her clothes. The shepherd was horrified at
beholding his wife approaching his house in a state of perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
nakedness. A Jean Gordon was once detected, by a shepherd,
stripping a female of her wearing-apparel. He at once
assisted the helpless woman; but Jean drew from below her
garments a dagger, and threw it at him. Evading the blow,
the shepherd closed in upon her, and struck her over the
head with his staff, knocking her to the ground. Another
Gipsy of the old fashion, of the name of Esther Grant, was
also celebrated for the practice of stripping people of their
clothing. The Arabian principle, expressed in these words,
on meeting a stranger in the desert, &#8220;Undress thyself&mdash;my
wife, (thy aunt,) is in want of a garment,&#8221; is truly applicable
to the disposition of the old female Gipsies.</p>

<p>Nothing was more common, in the counties of Peebles
and Lanark, when the country-people lost their purses at
fairs, than to have recourse to the chief Gipsy females, to
get their property returned to them. Mary Yorkston, having
a sovereign influence and power among her tribe, was
often applied to, in such cases of distress, of which the following
is a good specimen:&mdash;On one of these occasions, in a
market in the South of Scotland, a farmer lost his purse,
containing a considerable sum of money, which greatly perplexed
and distressed him. He immediately went to Mary
Yorkston, to try if she would exert her wonderful influence
to recover his property. Being a favourite of Mary&#8217;s, she,
without the least hesitation, took him along with her to the
place in the fair where her husband kept his temporary
dep&ocirc;t, or rather his office, in which he exercised his extraordinary
calling during the continuance of the market. The
presence of Mary was a sufficient assurance that all was
right; and, upon the matter being explained, Matthew
Baillie instantly produced, and spread out before the astonished
farmer, from twenty to thirty purses, and desired
him to pick out his own from amongst them. The countryman
soon recognized his own, and grasped at it without
ceremony. &#8220;Hold on,&#8221; said Baillie, &#8220;let us count its contents
first.&#8221; The Gipsy chief, with the greatest coolness
and deliberation, as if he had been an honest banker or
money-changer, counted over the money in the purse, when
not a farthing was found wanting. &#8220;There is your purse,
sir,&#8221; continued Baillie; &#8220;you see what it is, when honest
people meet!&#8221;</p>

<p>The following incident, that occurred one night after a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
fair, in a barn belonging to one of my relatives, will strikingly
illustrate the character of the Gipsies in the matter of
stealing purses:&mdash;A band of superior Gipsies were quartered
in the barn, after several of them had attended the
fair, in their usual manner. The principal female, whom I
shall not name, had also been at the market; but the old
chief had thought proper to remain at home, in the barn.
My relative, as was sometimes his custom, chanced to take
a turn about his premises that night, when it was pretty
late. He heard the voice of a female weeping in the barn,
and, being curious to know the cause of the disturbance
among the Tinklers, stepped softly up, close to the back of
the door, to listen to what they were doing, as the woman
was crying bitterly. He was greatly astonished at hearing,
and never could forget, the following expressions: &#8220;Oh,
cruel man, to beat me in this way. I have had my hands in
as good as twenty pockets, but the honest people had it not
to themselves.&#8221; The chieftain was, in fact, chastising his
wife, in the presence of his family, for her want of diligence
or success, in not obtaining enough of booty at the fair.
And yet this individual bore, among the country-people, the
character of an honest man.</p>

<p>Another story is told of Mary Yorkston and the Goodman
of Coulter-park. It differs in its nature from the
above anecdote, yet is very characteristic of the Gipsies.
Mary and her band were lurking one night at a place in
Clydesdale, called Raggingill. As a man on horseback approached
the spot where they were concealed, some of the
tribe immediately laid hold of the horse, and, without ceremony,
commenced to plunder the rider. But Mary, stepping
forth to superintend the operation, was astonished to
find that the horseman was her particular friend, the Goodman
of Coulter-park. She instantly exclaimed, with all her
might: &#8220;It&#8217;s Mr. Lindsay, the Gudeman o&#8217; Couter-park&mdash;let
him gang&mdash;let him gang&mdash;God bless him, honest man!&#8221;
It is needless to add that Mr. Lindsay had always given
Mary and her horde the use of an out-house when they required
it.</p>

<p>Mary Yorkston despised to ask what is properly understood
to be alms. She sold horn spoons and other
articles; and, when she made a bargain, she would take,
almost by force, what she called her &#8220;boontith,&#8221; which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
a present of victuals, exclusive of the cash paid; a practice
which I will explain further on in the chapter.</p>

<p>Matthew Baillie had, by Mary Yorkston, among other
children, a son, named James Baillie, who, along with his
brothers, as we have seen, threatened with destruction the
people assembled in Biggar fair, in consequence of an affront
offered to his mother by a gardener of that town. He was
condemned, in 1771, to be hung, for the murder of his wife,
by beating her with a horse-whip, and tumbling her over a
steep; but he &#8220;obtained a pardon from the king, on condition
that he transported himself beyond seas within a limited
time, otherwise the pardon was to have no effect.&#8221; Baillie,
paying little regard to the serious conditions of this pardon,
did not &#8220;transport himself beyond seas,&#8221; but continued
his former practices, as appears by the following extract
from the Weekly Magazine of the 8th October, 1772:&mdash;&#8220;James
Baillie, who was last summer condemned for the
murder of a woman, and afterwards obtained his majesty&#8217;s
pardon, on condition of transporting himself to America, for
life, was lately apprehended at Falkirk, on suspicion of robbery.
On the 1st October he was brought to town, and
committed to the Tolbooth, by a warrant of Lord Auchinleck.
This warrant was granted upon the petition of the
procurator fiscal of Stirling, in which he set forth that, as
Baillie was a very daring fellow, and suspected of being
concerned with a gang equally so with himself, there was
great reason to apprehend a rescue might be attempted, by
breaking the prison; and therefore praying that he might
be removed to Edinburgh, where a scheme of that nature
could not so easily be effected.&#8221; On the 18th December,
1773, and 27th February, 1774, the &#8220;Lords, in terms of the
said former sentence, decree and adjudge the said James
Baillie to be hanged on the 30th March then next.&#8221; He
thus appears to have remained in prison from October, 1772,
till March, 1774. &#8220;Soon after this sentence, he got another
pardon,&#8221; and was again discharged from prison, in order to
his transporting himself; but he remained at home, and again
relapsed into his former way of life. He was, some time
afterwards, committed to Newcastle gaol, but made his
escape. A short time after that, he was committed to
Carlisle gaol, on suspicion of having stolen some plate. On
the 4th December, 1776, three sheriff-officers set out from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Edinburgh, to bring him hither; but before they reached
Carlisle, he had again broken prison and escaped.<a name="FNanchor140" id="FNanchor140"></a><a href="#Footnote140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>During one of the periods of Baillie&#8217;s imprisonment, he
escaped from jail, attired as a female; having been assisted
by some of his tribe, residing in the Grass-market of Edinburgh.
Tradition states that the then Mistress Baillie, of
Lamington, and her family, used all their interest in obtaining
these pardons for James Baillie; who, like his fathers
before him, pretended to be a bastard relative of the family
of Lamington, and thereby escaped the punishment of death.
McLaurin justly remarks that &#8220;few cases have occurred in
which there has been such an expenditure of mercy.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor141" id="FNanchor141"></a><a href="#Footnote141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>I have already mentioned how handsomely the superior
order of Gipsies dressed at the period of which we are
speaking. The male head of the Ruthvens&mdash;a man six feet
some inches in height&mdash;who, according to the newspapers
of the day, lived to the advanced age of 115 years, when in
full dress, in his youth, wore a white wig, a ruffled shirt, a
blue Scottish bonnet, scarlet breeches and waistcoat, a long
blue superfine coat, white stockings, with silver buckles in
his shoes. Others wore silver brooches in their breasts,
and gold rings on their fingers. The male Gipsies in Scotland
were often dressed in green coats, black breeches, and
leathern aprons. The females were very partial to green
clothes. At the same time, the following anecdote will
show how artful they were at all times, by means of dress
and other equipments, to transform themselves, like actors
on the stage, into various characters, whenever it suited
their purposes.<a name="FNanchor142" id="FNanchor142"></a><a href="#Footnote142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>My father, when a young lad, noticed a large band of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Gipsies taking up their quarters one night in an old out-house
on a farm occupied by his father. The band had
never been observed on the farm before, and seemed all to
be strangers, with, altogether, a very ragged and miserable
appearance. Next morning, a little after breakfast, as the
band began to pack up their baggage, and load their asses,
preparatory to proceeding on their journey, the youth, out
of curiosity, went forward to see the horde decamp. Among
other articles of luggage, he observed a large and heavy
sack put upon one of the asses; and, as the Gipsies were
fastening it upon the back of the animal, the mouth of it
burst open, and the greater part of its contents fell upon
the ground. He was not a little surprised when he beheld
a great many excellent cocked hats, suits of fine green
clothes, great-coats, &amp;c.; with several handsome saddles and
bridles, tumble out of the bag. At this unexpected accident,
the Gipsies were much disconcerted. By some strange expressions
and odd man&oelig;uvres, they endeavoured to drive
the boy from their presence, and otherwise engage his attention,
to prevent him observing the singular furniture
contained in the unlucky sack. By thus carrying along
with them these superior articles, so unlike their ordinary
wretched habiliments, the ingenious Gipsies had it always
in their power to disguise themselves, whenever circumstances
called for it. The following anecdote will, in some
measure, illustrate the &#8220;gallant guise&#8221; in which these wanderers,
at one time, rode through Scotland:</p>

<p>About the year 1768, early in the morning of the day of
a fair, held annually at Peebles, in the month of May, two
gentlemen were observed riding along the only road that
led to my grandfather&#8217;s farm. One of the servant girls was
immediately told to put the parlour in order, to receive the
strangers, as, from their respectable appearance, at a distance,
it was supposed they were friends, coming to breakfast,
before going to the market; a custom common enough
in the country. This preparation, however, proved unnecessary,
as the strangers rode rapidly past the dwelling-house,
and alighted at the door of an old smearing-house, nearly
roofless, situated near some alder trees, about three hundred
yards further up a small mountain stream. In passing, they
were observed to be neatly dressed in long green coats,
cocked hats, riding-boots and spurs, armed with broad-swords,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
and mounted on handsome grey ponies, saddled and
bridled; everything, in short, in style, and of the best
quality. The people about the farm were extremely curious
to know who these handsomely-attired gentlemen could be,
who, without taking the least notice of any one, dismounted
at the wretched hovel of a sheep-smearing house, where
nothing but a band of Tinklers were quartered. Their
curiosity, however, was soon satisfied, and not a little mirth
was excited, on it being ascertained that the gallant horsemen
were none other than James and William Baillie, sons
of old Matthew Baillie, who, with part of his tribe, were, at
the moment, in the old house, making horn spoons. But
greater was their surprise, when several of the female
Gipsies set out, immediately afterwards, for the fair, attired
in very superior dresses, with the air of ladies in the middle
ranks of society.<a name="FNanchor143" id="FNanchor143"></a><a href="#Footnote143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>Besides the large hordes that traversed the south of Scotland,
parties of twos and threes also passed through the
country, apparently not at all connected, nor in communication,
at the time, with the large bands. When a single
Gipsy and his wife, or other female, were observed to take
up their quarters by themselves, it was supposed they had
either fallen out with their clan, or had the officers of the
law in pursuit of them. Sometimes the chiefs would enquire
of the country people, if such and such a one of their tribe
had passed by, this or that day, lately. Under any circumstances,
the presence of a female does not excite so much
suspicion as a single male. In following their profession, as
tinkers, the Gipsies seldom, or never, travel without a female
in their company, and, I believe, they sometimes hire them
to accompany them, to hawk their wares through the country.
The tinker keeps himself snug in an out-house, at his
work, while the female vends his articles of sale, and forages
for him, in the adjoining country.</p>

<p>One of these straggling Gipsies, of the name of William
Keith, was apprehended in an old smearing-house, on a farm
occupied by my grandfather, in Tweed-dale. William had
been concerned, with his brother Robert, in the murder of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
one of their clan, of the name of Charles Anderson, at a small
public-house among the Lammermoor hills, called Lourie&#8217;s
Den. Robert Keith and Anderson had fallen out, and had
followed each other for some time, for the purpose of fighting
out their quarrel. They at last met at Lourie&#8217;s Den, when
a terrible combat ensued. The two antagonists were brothers-in-law;
Anderson being married to Keith&#8217;s sister.
Anderson proved an over-match for Keith; and William
Keith, to save his brother, laid hold of Anderson; but Mage
Greig, Robert&#8217;s wife, handed her husband a knife, and called
on him to despatch him, while unable to defend himself.
Robert repeatedly struck with the knife, but it rebounded
from the ribs of the unhappy man, without much effect. Impatient
at the delay, Mage called out to him, &#8220;strike laigh,
strike laigh in;&#8221; and, following her directions, he stabbed
Anderson to the heart. The only remark made by any of
the gang was this exclamation from one of them: &#8220;Gude
faith, Rob, ye have done for him noo!&#8221; But William Keith
was astonished when he found that Anderson was stabbed
in his arms, as his interference was only to save the life of
his brother from the overwhelming strength of Anderson.
Robert Keith instantly fled, but was immediately pursued by
people armed with pitchforks and muskets. He was apprehended
in a braken-bush, in which he had concealed himself,
and was executed at Jedburgh, on the 24th November,
1772.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott, and the Ettrick Shepherd, slightly notice
this murder at Lourie&#8217;s Den, in their communications to
Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine. One of the individuals who assisted
at the apprehension of Keith was the father of Sir Walter
Scott. The following notice of this bloody scene appeared
in one of the periodical publications at the time it occurred:
&#8220;By a letter from Lauder, we are informed of the following
murder: On Wednesday se&#8217;night, three men, with a boy,
supposed to be tinkers, put up at a little public-house near
Soutra. From the after conduct of two of the men, it would
appear that a difference had subsisted between them, before
they came into the house, for they had drunk but very little
when the quarrel was renewed with great vehemence, and, in
the dispute, one of the fellows drew a knife, and stabbed the
other in the body no less than seven different times, of which
wounds he soon after expired. The gang then immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
made off; but upon the country-people being alarmed, the
murderer himself and one of the women were apprehended.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor144" id="FNanchor144"></a><a href="#Footnote144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>Long after this battle took place, James Bartram and
Robert Brydon, messengers-at-arms in Peebles, were dispatched
to apprehend William Keith, in the ruinous house
already mentioned. As they entered the building, early in
the morning, with cocked pistols in their hands, Keith, a
powerful man, rose up, half naked, from his <i>shake-down</i>, and,
holding out a pistol, dared them to advance. Bartram, the
chief officer, with the utmost coolness and bravery, advanced
close up to the muzzle of the Gipsy&#8217;s pistol, and, clapping his
own to the head of the desperate Tinkler, threatened him
with instant death if he did not surrender. A Gipsy, who
had informed against Keith, was with the officers, as their
guide; but the moment he saw Keith&#8217;s pistol, he artfully
threw himself, upon his back, to the ground. He immediately
rose to his feet, but, in great terror, sprang, like a
greyhound, over a <i>fauld dyke</i>, to escape the shot which
Keith threatened. The intrepid conduct of the officers completely
daunted the Gipsy. He yielded, and allowed himself
to be hand-cuffed, thinking that the messengers were
strongly supported by the servants on the farm; for, on perceiving
only the two officers, he became desperate, but he
was now fast in irons. In great bitterness he exclaimed,
&#8220;Had I not, on Saturday night, observed five stout men on
Mr. Simson&#8217;s turf-hill, ye wadna a&#8217; hae ta&#8217;en me.&#8221; The five
individuals were all remarkably strong men. It was on
Monday morning the Gipsy was apprehended, and it would
appear he had been reconnoitering on Saturday, before risking
to take up his quarters, which he did without asking
permission from any one. He imagined that the five turf-casters
were ready to assist the officers in the execution of
their duty, and that it would have been in vain for him to
make any resistance. The frantic Gipsy now leaped and
tossed about in the most violent manner imaginable. He
struck with so much vigour, with his hands bound in irons,
and kicked so powerfully with his feet, that it was with the
greatest difficulty the officers could get him carried to the
jail at Peebles. His wife came into the kitchen of the farm-house,
weeping and wailing excessively; and on some of the
servant-girls endeavouring to calm her grief, she, among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
other bitter expressions, exclaimed, &#8220;Had a decent, honest
man, like the master, informed, I would not have cared; but
for a blackguard like ourselves to inform, is unsufferable.&#8221;
Keith was tried, condemned, and banished to the plantations,
for the part he acted at the slaughter at Lourie&#8217;s Den.</p>

<p>Here we have seen the melancholy fate of two, if not
three, of the then <i>Gipsy constabulary force</i> in Peebles-shire;
one murdered, another hanged, and the third banished.
However strange it may appear at the present day, it is
nevertheless true, that the magistrates of this county, about
this period, (1772,) actually appointed and employed a number
of the principal Gipsies as peace officers, constables, or
country-keepers, as they were called, of whom I will speak
again in another place.</p>

<p>The nomadic Gipsies in general, like the Baillies in particular,
have gradually declined in appearance, till, at the
present day, the greater part of them have become little
better than beggars, when compared to what they were in
former times. Among those who frequented the south of
Scotland were to be found various grades of rank, as in all
other communities of men. There were then wretched and
ruffian-looking gangs, in whose company the superior Gipsies
would not have been seen.</p>

<p>The reader will have observed the complete protection
which William Baillie&#8217;s token afforded Robert McVitie,
when two men were about to rob him, while travelling with
his packs, between Elvanfoot and Moffat. This system of
tokens made part of the general internal polity of the Gipsies.
These curious people stated to me that Scotland was
at one time divided into districts, and that each district was
assigned to a particular tribe. The chieftains of these tribes
issued tokens to the members of their respective hordes,
&#8220;when they scattered themselves over the face of the country.&#8221;
The token of a local chieftain protected its bearer
only while within his own district. If found without this
token, or detected travelling in a district for which the
token was not issued, the individual was liable to be plundered,
beaten, and driven back into his own proper territory,
by those Gipsies on whose rights and privileges he had infringed.
These tokens were, at certain periods, called in
and renewed, to prevent any one from forging them. They
were generally made of tin, with certain characters impressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
upon them; and the token of each tribe had its own
particular mark, and was well known to all the Gipsies in
Scotland. But while these passes of the provincial chieftains
were issued only for particular districts, a token of the
Baillie family protected its bearer throughout the kingdom
of Scotland; a fact which clearly proves the superiority of
that ancient clan. Several Gipsies have assured me that
&#8220;a token from a Baillie was good over all Scotland, and that
kings and queens had come of that family.&#8221; And an old
Gipsy also declared to me that the tribes would get into
utter confusion, were the country not divided into districts,
under the regulations of tokens. It sometimes happened, as
in the case of Robert McVitie and others, that the Gipsies
gave passes or tokens to some of their particular favourites
who were not of their own race.</p>

<p>This system of Gipsy polity establishes a curious fact,
namely, the double division and occupation of the kingdom
of Scotland; by ourselves as a civilized people, and by a
barbarous community existing in our midst, each subject to
its own customs, laws and government; and that, while the
Gipsies were preying upon the vitals of the civilized society
which harboured them, and were amenable to its laws, they
were, at the same time, governed by the customs of their
own fraternity.</p>

<p>The surnames most common among the old Tweed-dale
bands of Gipsies were Baillie, Ruthven, Kennedy, Wilson,
Keith, Anderson, Robertson, Stewart, Tait, Geddes, Grey,
Wilkie and Halliday. The three principal clans were the
Baillies, Ruthvens and Kennedys; but, as I have already
mentioned, the tribe of Baillie were superior to all others,
in point of authority as well as in external appearance.<a name="FNanchor145" id="FNanchor145"></a><a href="#Footnote145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>Besides the christian and surnames common to them in
Scotland, the Gipsies have names in their own language;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span><a name="FNanchor146" id="FNanchor146"></a><a href="#Footnote146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
and, while travelling through the country, assume new names
every morning, before commencing the day&#8217;s journey, and
retain them till money is received, in one way or other, by
each individual of the company; but if no money is received
before twelve o&#8217;clock, they all, at noon-tide, resume their
permanent Scottish names. They consider it unlucky to set
out on a journey, in the morning, under their own proper
names; and if they are, by any chance, called back, by any
of their neighbours, they will not again stir from home for
that day. The Gipsies also frequently change their British
names when from home: in one part of the country they
have one name, and in another part they appear under a
different one, and so on.</p>

<hr class="c05" />

<p>I will now describe the appearance of the Gipsies in
Tweed-dale during the generation immediately following the
one in which we have considered them; and would make
this remark, that this account applies to them of late years,
with this exception, that the numbers in which the nomadic
class are to be met with are greatly reduced, their condition
greatly fallen, and the circumstances attending their
reception, countenance and toleration, much modified, and in
some instances totally changed.</p>

<p>Within the memories of my father and grandfather, which
take in about the last hundred years, none of the Gipsies
who traversed Tweed-dale carried tents with them for their
accommodation. The whole of them occupied the kilns and
out-houses in the country; and so thoroughly did they know
the country, and where these were to be found, and the disposition
of the owners of them, that they were never at a
loss for shelter in their wanderings.</p>

<p>Some idea may be formed of the number of Gipsies who
would sometimes be collected together, from the following
extract from the Clydesdale Magazine, for May, 1818:
&#8220;Mr. Steel, of Kilbucho Mill, bore a good name among
&#8216;tanderal gangerals.&#8217; His kiln was commodious, and some
hardwood trees, which surrounded his house, bid defiance
to the plough, and formed a fine pasture-sward for the cuddies,
on a green of considerable extent. On a summer Saturday
night, Mary came to the door, asking quarters, pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
late. She had only a single ass, and a little boy swung in
the panniers. She got possession of the kiln, as usual, and
the ass was sent to graze on the green; but Mary was only
the avant-garde. Next morning, when the family rose, they
counted no less than forty cuddies on the grass, and a man
for each of them in the kiln, besides women and children.&#8221;
Considering the large families the Gipsies generally have,
and allowing at this meeting two asses for carrying the infants
and luggage of each family, there could not have been
less than one hundred Gipsies on the spot.</p>

<p>My parents recollect the Gipsies, about the year 1775,
traversing the county of Tweed-dale, and parts of the surrounding
shires, in bands varying in numbers from ten to
upwards of thirty in each horde. Sometimes ten or twelve
horses and asses were attached to one large horde, for the
purpose of carrying the children, baggage, &amp;c. In the summer
of 1784, forty Gipsies, in one band, requested permission
of my father to occupy one of his out-houses. It was
good-humouredly observed to them that, when such numbers
of them came in one body, they should send their quarter-master
in advance, to mark out their camp. The Gipsies
only smiled at the remark. One half of them got the house
requested; the other half occupied an old, ruinous mill, a
mile distant. There were above seven of these large bands
which frequented the farms of my relatives in Tweed-dale
down to about the year 1790. A few years after this period,
when a boy, I assisted to count from twenty-four to thirty
Gipsies who took up their quarters in an old smearing-house
on one of these farms. The children, and the young folks
generally, were running about the old house like bees flying
about a hive. Their horses, asses, dogs, cats, poultry, and
tamed birds were numerous.</p>

<p>These bands did not repeat their visits above twice a
year, but in many instances the principal families remained
for three or four weeks at a time. From their manner and
conduct generally, they seemed to think that they had a
right to receive, from the family on whose grounds they
halted, food gratis for twenty-four hours; for, at the end of
that period, they almost always provided victuals for themselves,
however long they might remain on the farm. The
servants of my grandfather, when these large bands arrived,
frequently put on the kitchen fire the large family <i>kail-pot</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
of the capacity of thirty-two Scotch pints, or about sixteen
gallons, to cook victuals for these wanderers.</p>

<p>The first announcement of the approach of a Gipsy band
was the chief female, with, perhaps, a child on her back, and
another walking at her feet. The chieftain himself, with his
asses and baggage, which he seldom quits, is, perhaps, a mile
and a half in the rear, baiting his beasts of burden, near the
side of the road, waiting the return and report of his quarter-mistress.
This chief female requests permission for her
<i>gude-man</i> and <i>weary bairns</i> to take up their quarters for the
night, in an old out-house. Knowing perfectly the disposition
of the individual from whom she asks lodgings, she is
seldom refused. A farmer&#8217;s wife, whom I knew, on granting
this indulgence to a female in advance of her band, added,
by way of caution, &#8220;but ye must not steal anything from
me, then.&#8221; &#8220;We&#8217;ll no&#8217; play ony tricks on you, mistress;
but others will pay for that,&#8221; was the Gipsy&#8217;s reply.</p>

<p>Instead, however, of the chief couple and a child or two,
the out-house, before nightfall, or next morning, will perhaps
contain from twenty to thirty individuals of all ages and
sexes. The different members of the horde are observed to
arrive at head-quarters as single individuals, in twos, and in
threes; some of the females with baskets on their arms,
some of the males with fishing-rods in their hands, trout
creels on their backs, and large dogs at their heels. The
same rule is observed when the camp breaks up. The old
chief and two or three of his family generally take the van.
The other members of the band linger about the old house
in which they have been quartered, for several days after
the chiefs are gone; they, however, move off, in small parties
of twos or as single individuals, on different days, till the
whole horde gradually disappear. Above three grown-up
Gipsies are seldom seen travelling together. In this manner
have the Gipsies traversed the kingdom, concealing their
numbers from public observation, and only appearing in large
bands on the grounds of those individuals of the community
who were not disposed to molest them. On such occasions,
when the chief Gipsies continued encamped, they would be
visited by small parties of their friends, arriving and departing
almost daily.</p>

<p>Excepting that of sometimes allowing their asses to go,
under night, into the barn-yard, as if it were by accident, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
draw the stacks of corn, it is but fair and just to state, that
I am not aware of a single Gipsy ever having injured the
property of any of my relatives in Tweed-dale, although
their opportunities were many and tempting. My ancestor&#8217;s
extensive business required him, almost daily, to travel, on
horseback, over the greater part of the south of Scotland;
and he was often under the necessity of exposing himself,
by riding at night, yet he never received the slightest molestation,
to his knowledge, from the Gipsies. They were as
inoffensive and harmless as lambs to him, and to every one
connected with his family. Whenever they beheld him,
every head was uncovered, while they would exclaim,
&#8220;There is Mr. Simson; God bless him, honest man!&#8221; And
woe would have been to that man who would have dared to
treat him badly, had these determined wanderers been
present.</p>

<p>The Gipsies may be compared to the raven of the rock, as
a complete emblem of their disposition. Allow the <i>corbie</i>
shelter, and to build her nest in your cliffs and wastes, and
she will not touch your property; but harass her, and destroy
her brood, and she will immediately avenge herself upon
your young lambs, with terrible fury.<a name="FNanchor147" id="FNanchor147"></a><a href="#Footnote147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Washings of clothes,
of great value, were often left out in the fields, under night,
and were as safe as if they had been within the dwelling-house,
under lock and key, when the Gipsies happened to be
quartered on the premises. If any of their children had
dared to lay its hands upon the most trifling article, its parents
would have given it a severe beating. On one occasion,
when a Gipsy was beating one of his children, for
some trifling offence it had committed, my relative observed
to him that the boy had done no harm. &#8220;If he has not
been in fault just now, sir, it will not be long till he be in
one; so the beating he has got will not be thrown away on
him,&#8221; was the Tinkler&#8217;s reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>When the Gipsies took up their residence on the cold
earthen floor of an old out-house, the males and females of
the different families had always beds by themselves, made
of straw and blankets, and called shake-downs. The younger
branches also slept by themselves, in separate beds, the
males apart from the females. When the band consisted of
more families than one, each family occupied a separate part
of the floor of the house, distinct from their neighbours;
kindled a separate fire, at which they cooked their victuals;
and made horn spoons and other articles for themselves, for
sale in the way of their calling. They formed, as it were,
a camp on the ground-floor of the ruinous house, in which
would sometimes be observed five mothers of families, some
of whom would be such before they were seventeen years of
age. The principal Gipsies who, about this period, travelled
Tweed-dale, were never known to have had more than one
wife at a time, or to have put away their wives for trifling
causes.</p>

<p>On such occasions, the chief and the grown-up males of
the band seldom or never set foot within the door of the
farm-house, but generally kept themselves quite aloof and
retired; exposing themselves to observation as little as possible.
They employed themselves in repairing broken
china, utensils made of copper, brass and pewter, pots, pans
and kettles, and white-iron articles generally; and in making
horn spoons, smoothing-irons, and sole-clouts for ploughs.
But working in horn is considered by them as their favourite
and most ancient occupation. It would certainly be one of
the first employments of man, at a very early stage of human
society&mdash;that of converting the horns of animals for the use
of the human race: and such has been the regard which
the Gipsies have had for it, that every clan knows the
spoons which are made by another. The females also
assisted in polishing, and otherwise finishing, the spoons.
However early the farm-servants rose to their ordinary employments,
they always found the Tinklers at work.</p>

<p>A considerable portion of the time of the males was occupied
in athletic amusements. They were constantly exercising
themselves in leaping, cudgel-playing, throwing the
hammer, casting the putting-stone, playing at golf, quoits,
and other games; and while they were much given, on other
occasions, to keep themselves from view, the extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
ambition which they all possessed, of beating every one they
met with, at these exercises, brought them sometimes in contact
with the men about the farm, master as well as servants.
They were fond of getting the latter to engage with them,
for the purpose of laughing at their inferiority in these
healthy and manly amusements; but when any of the country-people
chanced to beat them at these exercises, as was
sometimes the case, they could not conceal their indignation
at the affront. Their haughty scowl plainly told that they
were ready to wipe out the insult in a different and more
serious manner. Indeed, they were always much disposed
to treat farm-servants with contempt, as quite their inferiors
in the scale of society; and always boasted of their own
high birth, and the antiquity of their family. They were
extremely fond of the athletic amusement of &#8220;o&#8217;erending
the tree,&#8221; which was performed in this way: The end of a
spar or beam, above six feet long, and of a considerable
thickness and weight, is placed upon the upper part of the
right foot, and held about the middle, in a perpendicular
position, by the right hand. Standing upon the left foot,
and raising the right a little from the ground, and drawing
it as far back as possible, and then bringing the foot forward
quickly to the front, the spar is thrown forward into
the air, from off the foot, with great force. And he who
&#8220;overends the tree&#8221; the greatest number of times in the
air, before it reaches the ground, is considered the most expert,
and the strongest man. A great many of these Gipsies
had a saucy military gesture in their walk, and generally
carried in their hands short, thick cudgels, about three
feet in length. While they travelled, they generally unbuttoned
the knees of their breeches, and rolled down the heads
of their stockings, so as to leave the joints of their knees
bare, and unincumbered by their clothes.</p>

<p>During the periods they occupied the out-houses of the
farms, the owners of which were kind to them, the Gipsies
were very orderly in their deportment, and temperate in
the use of spirituous liquors, being seldom seen intoxicated;
and were very courteous and polite to all the members of
the family. Their behaviour was altogether very orderly,
peaceable, quiet, and inoffensive. In gratitude for their
free-quarters, they frequently made, from old metal, smoothing-irons
for the mistress, and sole-clouts for the ploughs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the master, and spoons for the family, from the horns of
rams, or other horns that happened to be about the house;
for all of which they would take nothing. They, however,
did not attend the church, while encamped on the premises;
at the same time, they took especial care to give no molestation,
or cause of offence, to any about the farm, on Sunday;
being, indeed, seldom seen on that day out-side of the door
of the house in which they were quartered, saving an individual
to look after their horses or asses, while grazing in
the neighbouring fields. Their religious sentiments were
confined entirely within their own breasts; and it was impossible
to know what were their real opinions on the score
of religion. However, within the last ten years, I enquired,
very particularly, of an intelligent Gipsy, what religion his
forefathers professed, and his answer was, that &#8220;the Gipsies
had no religious sentiments at all; that they worshipped no
sort of thing whatever.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many practised music; and the violin and bag-pipes
were the instruments they commonly used. This musical
talent of the Gipsies delighted the country-people; it operated
like a charm upon their feelings, and contributed much
to procure the wanderers a night&#8217;s quarters. Many of the
families of the farmers looked forward to the expected visits
of the merry Gipsies with pleasure, and regretted their departure.
Some of the old women sold salves and drugs,
while some of the males had pretensions to a little surgery.
One of them, of the name of Campbell, well known by the
title of Dr. Duds, traversed the south of Scotland, accompanied
by a number of women. He prescribed, and sold medicines
to the inhabitants; and several odd stories are told
of the very unusual, but successful, cures performed by
him.</p>

<p>As in arranging for, and taking up, their quarters, the
principal female Gipsy almost always negotiates the transactions
which the horde have with the farmer&#8217;s family, during
their abode on his premises. Indeed, the females are the most
active, if not the principal, members of the tribe, in vending
their articles of merchandise. The time at which, on such
occasions, they present these for sale, is the day after their
arrival on the farm, and immediately after the breakfast of
the farmer&#8217;s family is over. When there are more families
than one in the band, but all of one horde, the chief female<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
of the whole gets the first chance of selling her wares; but
every head female of the respective families bargains for
her own merchandise, for the behoof of her own family.
When the farmer&#8217;s family is in want of any of their articles,
an extraordinary higgling and chaffering takes place in
making the bargain. Besides money, the Gipsy woman insists
upon having what she calls her &#8220;boontith&#8221;&mdash;that is, a
present in victuals, as she is fond of bartering her articles
for provisions. If the mistress of the house agrees, and goes
to her larder or milk-house for the purpose of giving her
this boontith, the Gipsy is sure to follow close at her heels.
Admitted into the larder, the voracious Tinkler will have
part of everything she sees&mdash;flesh, meal, butter, cheese, &amp;c.,
&amp;c. Her fiery and penetrating eye darts, with rapidity, from
one object to another. She makes use of every argument
she can think of to induce the farmer&#8217;s wife to comply
with her unreasonable demands. &#8220;I&#8217;m wi&#8217; bairn, mistress,&#8221;
she will say; &#8220;I&#8217;m greenin&#8217;; God bless ye, gie me a wee bit
flesh to taste my mouth, if it should no&#8217; be the book o&#8217; a
robin-red-breast.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor148" id="FNanchor148"></a><a href="#Footnote148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> If the farmer&#8217;s wife still disregards her
importunities, the Gipsy will, in the end, snatch up a piece
of flesh, and put it into her lap, in a twinkling; for out of
the larder she will not go, without something or other. The
farmer&#8217;s wife, ever on the alert, now takes hold of the <i>sorner</i>,
to wrest the flesh from her clutches, when a serious personal
struggle ensues. She will frequently be under the necessity
of calling for the assistance of her servants, to thrust the
intruder out of the apartment; but the cautious Gipsy takes
care not to let matters go too far: she yields the contest,
and, laughing heartily at the good-wife losing her temper,
immediately assumes her ordinary polite manner. And notwithstanding
all that has taken place, both parties generally
part on good terms.</p>

<p>On one of these bargain-making occasions, as the wife of the
farmer of Glencotha, in Tweed-dale, went to give a boontith
to Mary Yorkston, the harpy thrust, unobserved, about four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
pounds weight of tallow into her lap. On the return of the
good-wife, the tallow was missed. She charged Mary with
the theft, but Mary, with much gravity of countenance, exclaimed:
&#8220;God bless ye, mistress, I wad steal from mony a
one before I wad steal from you.&#8221; The good-wife, however,
took hold of Mary, to search her person. A struggle
ensued, when the tallow fell out of Mary&#8217;s lap, on the kitchen-floor.
At this exposure, in the very act of stealing, the
Gipsy burst into a fit of laughter, exclaiming: &#8220;The Lord
hae a care o&#8217; me, mistress; ye hae surely little to spare,
whan ye winna let a body take a bit tauch for a candle, to
light her to bed.&#8221; At another time, this Gipsy gravely
told the good-wife of Rachan-mill, that she must give her a
pound of butter for her boontith, that time, as it would be
the last she would ever give her. Astonished at the extraordinary
saying, the good-wife demanded, with impatience,
what she meant. &#8220;You will,&#8221; rejoined the Gipsy, &#8220;be in
eternity (by a certain day, which she named,) and I will
never see you again; and this will be the last boontith you
will ever give me.&#8221; The good-wife of Rachan-mill, however,
survived the terrible prediction for several years.<a name="FNanchor149" id="FNanchor149"></a><a href="#Footnote149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>The female Gipsies also derived considerable profits from
their trade of fortune-telling. The art of telling fortunes
was not, however, general among the Gipsies; it was only
certain old females who pretended to be inspired with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
gift of prophecy. The method which they adopted to get
at the information which often enabled them to tell, if not
fortunes, at least the history, and condition of mind, of individuals,
with great accuracy, was somewhat this:</p>

<p>The inferior Gipsies generally attended our large country
&#8220;penny-weddings&#8221;, in former times, both as musicians and
for the purpose of receiving the fragments of the entertainments.
At the wedding in the parish of Corstorphine, to
which I have alluded, under the chapter of <a href="#Page_140">Fife and Stirlingshire
Gipsies</a>, Charles Stewart entered into familiar conversation
with individuals present; joking with them about
their sweet-hearts, and love-matters generally; telling them
he had noticed such a one at such a place; and observing
to another that he had seen him at such a fair, and so on.
He always enquired about their masters, and places of abode,
with other particulars relative to their various connections
and circumstances in life. Here, the Gipsy character displays
itself; here, we see Stewart, while he seems a mere
merry-andrew, to the heedless, merry-making people at these
weddings, actually reading, with deep sagacity, their characters
and dispositions; and ascertaining the places of
residence, and connexions, of many of the individuals of the
country through which he travelled. In this manner, by
continually roaming up and down the kingdom, now as individuals
in disguise, at other times in bands&mdash;not passing
a house in their route&mdash;observing everything taking place
in partial assemblies, at large weddings, and general gatherings
of the people at fairs&mdash;scanning, with the eye of a
hawk, both males and females, for the purpose of robbing
them&mdash;did the Gipsies, with their great knowledge of human
character, become thoroughly acquainted with particular
incidents concerning many individuals of the population.
Hence proceed, in a great measure, the warlockry and
fortune-telling abilities of the shrewd and sagacious Gipsies.</p>

<p>Or, suppose an old Gipsy female, who traverses the kingdom,
has a relative a lady&#8217;s maid in a family of rank, and
another a musician in a band, playing to the first classes of
society, in public or private assemblies, the travelling <i>spae-wife</i>
would not be without materials for carrying on her
trade of fortune-telling. The observant handmaid, and the
acute, penetrating fiddler would, of course, communicate to
their wandering relative every incident and circumstance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
that came under their notice, which would, at an after and
suitable period, enable the cunning fortune-teller to astonish
some of the parties who had been at these meetings, when in
another part of the country, remote in time, and distant in
place, from the spot where the occurrences happened.</p>

<p>In order that they might not lessen the importance and
value of their art, these Gipsies pretended they could tell
no one&#8217;s fortune for anything less than silver, or articles
of wearing-apparel, or other things of value. Besides telling
fortunes by palmistry,<a name="FNanchor150" id="FNanchor150"></a><a href="#Footnote150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> they foretold destinies by divination
of the cup, their method of doing which appears to be nearly
the same as that practised among the ancient Assyrians,
Chaldeans, and Egyptians, perhaps, about the time of Joseph.
The Gipsy method was, and I may say is, this: The divining
cup, which is made of tin, or pewter, and about three
inches in diameter, was filled with water, and sometimes
with spirits. Into the cup a certain quantity of a melted
substance, resembling tin, was dropped from a crucible,
which immediately formed itself, in the liquid, into curious
figures, resembling frost-work, seen on windows in winter.
The compound was then emptied into a trencher, and from
the arrangements or constructions of the figures, the destiny
of the enquiring individual was predicted.<a name="FNanchor151" id="FNanchor151"></a><a href="#Footnote151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> While performing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the ceremony, the Gipsies muttered, in their own
language, certain incantations, totally unintelligible to the
spectator. The following fact, however, will, more particularly,
show the manner in which these Gipsy sorceresses imposed
on the credulous.</p>

<p>A relative of mine had several servant-girls who would,
one day, have their fortunes told. The old Gipsy took them,
one at a time, into an apartment of the house, and locked the
door after her. My relative, feeling a curiosity in the matter,
observed their operations, and overheard their conversation,
through a chink in the partition of the room. A
bottle of whiskey, and a wine glass, were produced by the
girl, and the sorceress filled the glass, nearly full, with the
spirits. Into the liquor she dropped part of the white of a
raw egg, and taking out of her pocket something like chalk,
scraped part of it into the mixture. Certain figures now
appeared in the glass, and, muttering some jargon, unintelligible
to the girl, she held it up between her eyes and the
window. &#8220;There is your sweetheart now&mdash;look at him&mdash;do
you not see him?&#8221; exclaimed the Gipsy to the trembling
girl; and, after telling her a number of events which were
to befall her, in her journey through life, she held out the
glass, and told her to &#8220;cast that in her mouth&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Me drink
that? The Lord forbid that I should drink a drap o&#8217;t.&#8221;
&#8220;E&#8217;ens ye like, my woman; I can tak&#8217; it mysel,&#8221; quoth the
Gipsy, and, suiting the action to the word, &#8220;cast&#8221; the whiskey,
eggs and chalk<a name="FNanchor152" id="FNanchor152"></a><a href="#Footnote152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> down her throat, in an instant. Knowing
well that the idea of swallowing the glass in which
their future husbands were seen, and their own fortunes
told, in so mysterious a manner, would make the girls shudder,
the cunning Gipsy gave each of them, in succession, the
order to drink, and, the moment they refused, threw the contents
of the &#8220;divining cup&#8221; into her own mouth. In this
manner did the Gipsy procure, at one time, no less than
four glasses of ardent spirits, and sixpence from each of the
credulous girls.</p>

<p>The country-girls, however, never could stand out the
operations of telling fortunes by the method of turning a
corn-riddle, with scissors attached, in a solitary out-house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Whenever the Gipsy commenced her work, and, with her
mysterious mutterings, called out: &#8220;Turn riddle&mdash;turn&mdash;shears
and all,&#8221; the terrified girls fled to the house, impressed
with the belief that the devil himself would appear to
them, on the spot.</p>

<p>The Gipsies in Tweed-dale were never in want of the best
of provisions, having always an abundance of fish, flesh, and
fowl. At the stages at which they halted, in their progress
through the country, it was observed that the principal families,
at one time, ate as good victuals, and drank as good
liquors, as any of the inhabitants of the country. A lady of
respectability informed me of her having seen, in her youth, a
band dine on the green-sward, near Douglass-mill, in Lanarkshire,
when, as I have already mentioned, the Gipsies handed
about their wine, after dinner, as if they had been as good
a family as any in the land. Those in Fifeshire, as we have
already seen, were in the habit of purchasing and killing fat
cattle, for their winter&#8217;s provisions. In a communication to
Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine, to which I will again allude, the
illustrious author of &#8220;Waverley&#8221; mentions that his grandfather
was, in some respects, forced to accept a dinner from
a party of Gipsies, carousing on a moor, on the Scottish Border.
The feast consisted of &#8220;all the varieties of game,
poultry, pigs, and so forth.&#8221; And, according to the same
communication, it would appear that they were in the practice
of stewing game and all kinds of poultry into soup,
which is considered very rich and savoury, and is now
termed &#8220;Pottage a la Meg Merrilies de Derncleugh;&#8221; a
name derived from the singular character in the celebrated
novel of Guy Mannering.</p>

<p>But the ancient method of cooking practised among the
Scottish Gipsies, and which, in all probability, they brought
with them, when they arrived in Europe, upwards of four
hundred years ago, is, if I am not mistaken, new to the world,
never having as yet, that I am aware of, been described.<a name="FNanchor153" id="FNanchor153"></a><a href="#Footnote153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
It is very curious, and extremely primitive, and appears to
be of the highest antiquity. It is admirably adapted to the
wants of a rude and barbarous people, travelling over a wild
and thinly-inhabited country, in which cooking utensils could
not be procured, or conveniently carried with them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
My facts are from the Gipsies themselves, and are corroborated
by people, not of the tribe, who have witnessed some
of their cooking operations.</p>

<p>The Gipsies, on such occasions, make use of neither pot,
pan, spit, nor oven, in cooking fowls. They twist a
strong rope of straw, which they wind very tightly around
the fowl, just as it is killed, with the whole of its feathers
on, and its entrails untouched. It is then covered with
hot peat ashes, and a slow fire is kept up around and about
the ashes, till the fowl is sufficiently done. When taken out
from beneath the fire, it is stripped of its hull, or shell, of
half-burned straw-rope and feathers, and presents a very
fine appearance. Those who have tasted poultry, cooked by
the Gipsies, in this manner, say that it is very palatable
and good. In this invisible way, these ingenious people
could cook stolen poultry, at the very moment, and in the
very place, that a search was going on for the pilfered
article.</p>

<p>The art of cooking butcher-meat among the Gipsies is
similar to that of making ready fowls, except that linen
and clay are substituted for feathers and straw. The piece
of flesh to be cooked is first carefully wrapped up in a covering
of cloth or linen rags, and covered over with well
wrought clay, and either frequently turned before a strong
fire, or covered over with hot ashes, till it is roasted, or
rather stewed. The covering or crust, of the shape of the
article enclosed, and hard with the fire, is broken, and the
meat separated from its inner covering of burned rags,
which, with the juice of the meat, are reduced to a thick
sauce or gravy. Sometimes a little vinegar is poured upon
the meat. The tribe are high in their praise of flesh cooked
in this manner, declaring that it has a particularly fine
flavour. These singular people, I am informed, also boiled
the flesh of sheep in the skins of the animals, like the
Scottish soldiers in their wars with the English nation,
when their camp-kettles were nothing but the hides of the
oxen, suspended from poles, driven into the ground.</p>

<p>The only mode of cooking butcher-meat, bearing any
resemblance to that of the Gipsies, is practised by some of
the tribes of South America, who wrap flesh in <i>leaves</i>, and,
covering it over with clay, cook it like the Gipsies. Some
of the Indians of North America roast deer of a small size<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
in their skins, among hot ashes. An individual of great
respectability, who had tasted venison cooked in this fashion,
said that it was extremely juicy, and finely flavoured. In
the Sandwich Islands, pigs are baked on hot stones in pits,
or in the leaves of the bread-fruit tree, on hot stones, covered
over with earth, during the operation of cooking. It is probable
that the Gipsy art of cooking would be amongst the
first modes of making ready animal food, in the first stage
of human society, in Asia&mdash;the cradle of the human race.<a name="FNanchor154" id="FNanchor154"></a><a href="#Footnote154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
Substitute linen rags for the leaves of trees, and what method
of cooking can be more primitive than that of our
Scottish Gipsies?</p>

<p>The Gipsy method of smelting iron, for sole-clout for
ploughs, and smoothing-irons, is also simple, rude, and primitive.<a name="FNanchor155" id="FNanchor155"></a><a href="#Footnote155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
The tribe erect, on the open field, a small circle,
built of stone, turf, and clay, for a furnace, of about three feet
in height, and eighteen inches in diameter, and plastered,
closely round on the outside, up to the top, with mortar made
of clay. The circle is deepened by part of the earth being
scooped out from the inside. It is then filled with coal or
charred peat; and the iron to be smelted is placed in small
pieces upon the top. Below the fuel an aperture is left
open, on one side, for admitting a large iron ladle, lined
inside with clay. The materials in the furnace are powerfully
heated, by the blasts of a large hand-bellows, (generally
wrought by females,) admitted at a small hole, a little
from the ground. When the metal comes to a state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
fusion, it finds its way down to the ladle, and, after being
skimmed of its cinders, is poured into the different sand
moulds ready to receive it.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote121" id="Footnote121"></a><a href="#FNanchor121"><span class="label">[121]</span></a> This claim appears doubtful, for there were Gipsies of the name of
Baillie (Bailyow) as far back as 1540, as already mentioned. However,
the particulars of the laird&#8217;s intrigue with the beautiful Gipsy girl, are imprinted
on the minds of the Gipsies of that name at the present day.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote122" id="Footnote122"></a><a href="#FNanchor122"><span class="label">[122]</span></a> The Gipsies were not spared of <i>braxy</i>, of which they were fond. I have
known natives of Tweed-dale and Ettrick Forest, who preferred <i>braxy</i> to
the best meat <i>killed by the hand of man</i>. It has a particular <i>sharp</i> relish,
which made them so fond of it.</p>

<p>[Braxy is the flesh of sheep which have died of a certain disease. When
the Gipsies are taunted with eating what some call carrion, they very
wittily reply: &#8220;The flesh of a beast which God kills must be better than
that of one killed by the hand of man.&#8221; Such flesh, &#8220;killed by the hand of
God,&#8221; is often killed in this manner: They will administer to swine a drug
affecting the brain only, which will cause speedy death; when they will
call and obtain the carcass, without suspicion, and feast on the flesh, which
has been in no way injured.&mdash;<i>Borrow.</i> They will also stuff wool down a
sheep&#8217;s throat, and direct the farmer&#8217;s attention to it when near its last gasp,
and obtain the carcass after being skinned.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p><a name="Footnote123" id="Footnote123"></a><a href="#FNanchor123"><span class="label">[123]</span></a> It is interesting to notice that the Doctor calls this Gipsy a &#8220;bold and
proper fellow.&#8221; He was, in all probability, a fine specimen of physical
manhood.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote124" id="Footnote124"></a><a href="#FNanchor124"><span class="label">[124]</span></a> The Scottish Gipsies, as I have already said, have a tradition that their
ancestors came into Scotland by way of Ireland.</p>

<p>[The allusion to that circumstance by the Gipsies, on this occasion, was
evidently to throw dust into the eyes of the Scottish authorities, by whom
the whole tribe in Scotland were proscribed.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p><a name="Footnote125" id="Footnote125"></a><a href="#FNanchor125"><span class="label">[125]</span></a> This seems a favourite title among the Tinklers. One, of the name of
Young, bears it at the present time. But the Gipsies are not singular in
these terrible titles. In the late Burmese war, we find his Burmese majesty
creating one of his generals &#8220;King of Hell, Prince of Darkness.&#8221;&mdash;See
<i>Constable&#8217;s Miscellany</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote126" id="Footnote126"></a><a href="#FNanchor126"><span class="label">[126]</span></a> A friend, in writing me, says: &#8220;I still think I see him, (Muckle Wull,)
bruising the charred peat over the flame of his furnace, with hands equal
to two pair of hands of the modern day; while his withered and hairy
shackle-bones were more like the postern joints of a sorrel cart-horse than
anything else.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote127" id="Footnote127"></a><a href="#FNanchor127"><span class="label">[127]</span></a> This Gipsy battle is alluded to by Sir Walter Scott, in a postscript to a
letter to Captain Adam Ferguson, 16th April, 1819.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the by, old Kennedy the tinker swam for his life at Jedburgh,
and was only, by the sophisticated and timed evidence of a seceding doctor,
who differed from all his brethren, saved from a well-deserved gibbet. He
goes to botanize for fourteen years. Pray tell this to the Duke (of Buccleuch,)
for he was an old soldier of the Duke, and the Duke&#8217;s old soldier. Six of
his brethren were, I am told, in the court, and kith and kin without end.
I am sorry so many of the clan are left. The cause of the quarrel with
the murdered man, was an old feud between two Gipsy clans, the Kennedys
and Irvings, which, about forty years since, gave rise to a desperate quarrel
and battle at Hawick-green, in which the grandfather of both Kennedy and
the man whom he murdered were engaged.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Lockhart&#8217;s Life of Sir Walter
Scott.</i> Alexander Kennedy was tried for murdering Irving, at Yarrowford.</p>

<p>[This Gipsy fray at Hawick is known among the English Gipsies as
&#8220;the Battle of the Bridge.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p><a name="Footnote128" id="Footnote128"></a><a href="#FNanchor128"><span class="label">[128]</span></a> Grellmann, on the Hungarian Gipsies, says: &#8220;They are loquacious
and quarrelsome in the highest degree. In the public markets, and before
ale-houses, where they are surrounded by spectators, they bawl, spit at
each other, catch up sticks and cudgels, vapour and brandish them over
their heads, throw dust and dirt; now run from each other, then back
again, with furious gestures and threats. The women scream, drag their
husbands by force from the scene of action; these break from them again,
and return to it. The children, too, howl piteously.&#8221; But I am at a loss
to understand the object of such an affray, as given by this author, on
any other theory than that of collecting crowds, in the places mentioned,
to enable them the more easily to pick pockets. For Grellmann adds:
&#8220;After a short time, without any persons interfering, when they have cried
and make a noise till they are tired, and without either party having received
any personal injury, the affair terminates, and they separate with
as much ostentation as if they had performed the most heroic feat.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote129" id="Footnote129"></a><a href="#FNanchor129"><span class="label">[129]</span></a> It is astonishing how trifling a circumstance will sometimes set such
Gipsies by the ears. In England, they will frequently &#8220;cast up&#8221; the history
of their respective families on such occasions. &#8220;What was your father, I
would like to know? He hadn&#8217;t even an ass to carry his traps, and was a
rogue at that, you &mdash;&mdash; Gipsy. <i>My</i> father was an honest man.&#8221; &#8220;<i>Honest</i>
man?&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Yes, honest man, and that&#8217;s more than you can say of your kin.&#8221;
The other, having more of &#8220;the blood,&#8221; will taunt his acquaintance with
some such expression as &#8220;Gorgio like,&#8221; (like the white.)&mdash;&#8220;And what are
you, you black trash? Will blood put money in your pocket? Blood,
indeed! I&#8217;m a better Gipsy than you are, in spite of the black devil that
every one sees in your face!&#8221; Then the fray commences.</p>

<p>When Gipsies take up their quarters on the premises of country people,
a very effectual way of sometimes getting rid of them is to stir up discord
among them. For when it comes to &#8220;hammers and tongs,&#8221; &#8220;tongs and
hammers,&#8221; they will scatter, uttering howls of vengeance, on some more
appropriate occasion, against their most intimate friends, who have just
incurred their wrath, yet who will be seen &#8220;cheek by jowl&#8221; with them, perhaps,
the next day, or even before the sun has gone down upon them; so
easily are they sometimes irritated, and so easily reconciled.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote130" id="Footnote130"></a><a href="#FNanchor130"><span class="label">[130]</span></a> A writer in Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine mentions that the Gipsies, late in
the seventeenth century, broke into the house of Pennicuik, when the greater
part of the family were at church. Sir John Clerk, the proprietor, barricaded
himself in his own apartment, where he sustained a sort of siege&mdash;firing
from the windows upon the robbers, who fired upon him in return.
One of them, while straying through the house in quest of booty, happened
to ascend the stairs of a very narrow turret, but, slipping his foot, caught
hold of the rope of the alarm bell, the ringing of which startled the congregation
assembled in the parish church. They instantly came to the rescue
of the Laird, and succeeded, it is said, in apprehending some of the Gipsies,

in the records of the family.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote131" id="Footnote131"></a><a href="#FNanchor131"><span class="label">[131]</span></a> A great many of the inferior Gipsy chiefs travelled with a number of

Lundie, and others.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote132" id="Footnote132"></a><a href="#FNanchor132"><span class="label">[132]</span></a> Dr. Alexander Carlyle, in a note to his autobiography, mentions having
seen this Jock Johnstone hanged. The date given by him (1738), differs,
however, from that mentioned above. According to him, Johnstone
was but twenty years of age, but bold, and a great ringleader, and was condemned
for robbery, and being accessory to a murder. The usual place of
execution was a moor, adjoining the town; but, as it was strongly reported
that the &#8220;thieves&#8221; were collecting from all quarters, to rescue the criminal
from the gallows, the magistrates erected the scaffold in front of the prison,
with a platform connecting, and surrounded it with about a hundred of the
stoutest burgesses, armed with Lochaber axes. Jock made his appearance,
surrounded by six officers. He was curly-haired, and fierce-looking, about
five feet eight inches in height, and very strong of his size. At first he appeared
astonished, but, looking around awhile, proceeded with a bold step.
Psalms and prayers being over, and the rope fastened about his neck, he
was ordered to mount a short ladder, attached to the gallows, in order to
be thrown off; when he immediately seized the rope, and pulled so violently
at it as to be in danger of bringing down the gallows&mdash;causing much
emotion among the crowd, and fear among the magistrates. Jock, becoming
furious, like a wild beast, struggled and roared, and defied the six officers
to bind him; and, recovering the use of his arms, became more formidable.
The magistrates then with difficulty prevailed on by far the strongest
man in Dumfries, for the honour of the town, to come on the scaffold.
Putting aside the six officers, this man seized the criminal, with as little
difficulty as a nurse handles her child, and in a few minutes bound him
hand and foot; and quietly laying him down on his face, near the edge
of the scaffold, retired. Jock, the moment he felt his grasp, found himself
subdued, and, becoming calm, resigned himself to his fate.&mdash;<i>Carlyle&#8217;s Autobiography.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

Arabs to shipwrecked Christians, on the coasts of the Red Sea, says:&mdash;&#8220;The
Arabian, with his lance, draws a circle large enough to hold you and
yours. He then strikes his lance in the sand, and bids you abide within the
circle. You are thus as safe, on the desert coast of Arabia, as in a citadel;
there is no example or exception to the contrary that has ever been known.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Bruce&#8217;s

<p><a name="Footnote134" id="Footnote134"></a><a href="#FNanchor134"><span class="label">[134]</span></a> It might be supposed that the pride of a Gipsy would have the good
effect of rendering him cautious not to be guilty of such crimes as subject
him to public shame. But here his levity of character is rendered conspicuous;
for he never looks to the right or to the left in his transactions;
and though his conceit and pride are somewhat humbled, during the time
of punishment, and while the consequent pain lasts; these being over, he
no longer remembers his disgrace, but entertains quite as good an opinion
of himself as before.&mdash;<i>Grellmann on the Hungarian Gipsies.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote137" id="Footnote137"></a><a href="#FNanchor137"><span class="label">[137]</span></a> What our author says of &#8220;the usual Gipsy policy of making the people
believe that they are descended from families of rank and influence in the
country,&#8221; (<a href="#Page_154">page 154</a>,) and that &#8220;the greater part of them will tell you that
they are sprung from a bastard son of this or that noble family, or other
person of rank and influence, of their own surname,&#8221; (<a href="#Page_117">117</a>,) is doubtless
true as a rule; but there were as likely cases of what the Gipsies assert,
and that Gipsy women, &#8220;in some instances, bore children to some of the
&#8216;unspotted gentlemen&#8217; mentioned by act of parliament as having so greatly
protected and entertained the tribe,&#8221; (<a href="#Page_114">114</a>,) and that Baillie was one of
them, (<a href="#Page_121">121</a> and <a href="#Page_185">185</a>.) If Baillie had been following the occupation, and
bearing the reputation, of an ordinary native of Scotland, there would have
been some chance &#8220;that great interest would be used to save a bastard
branch of an honourable house from an ignominious death upon the scaffold,&#8221;
for almost any offence he had committed, but not for one who was
guilty of &#8220;sorning, pickery, and little thieving, and habit and repute an
Egyptian.&#8221; There was doubtless a connexion, in <i>Gipsy</i> blood, between Baillie
and his influential friends who saved him and his relatives so often from
the gallows.&mdash;<i>See Baillies of Lamington and McLaurin&#8217;s Criminal Trials,

added to their names. [Brazier is a favourite name with the Gipsies, and
sounds better than tinker. Southey, in his Life of Bunyan, says: &#8220;It is

<p><a name="Footnote142" id="Footnote142"></a><a href="#FNanchor142"><span class="label">[142]</span></a> It appears, from Vidocq&#8217;s memoirs, that the Gipsies on the continent
changed their apparel, so as they could not again be recognized: &#8220;At break
of day everybody was on foot, and the general toilet was made. But for
their (the Gipsies&#8217;) prominent features, their raven-black tresses, and oily
and tanned skins, I should scarcely have recognized my companions of the
preceding evening. The men, clad in rich jockey Holland vests, with
leathern sashes like those worn by the men of Poirsy, and the women,
covered with ornaments of gold and silver, assumed the costume of Zealand
peasants; even the children, whom I had seen covered with rags, were
neatly clothed, and had an entirely different appearance. All soon left the
house, and took different directions, that they might not reach the market
place together, where the country-people were assembled in crowds.&#8221;&mdash;Vidocq
had lodged all night in a ruinous house, with a band of Gipsies.</p>

horses, with side-saddles and bridles, the ladies themselves being very
gaily dressed. The males wore scarlet cloaks, reaching to their knees, and
resembling exactly the Spanish fashion of the present day.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote145" id="Footnote145"></a><a href="#FNanchor145"><span class="label">[145]</span></a> According to Hoyland, the most common names among the English
tented Gipsies are Smith, Cooper, Draper, Taylor, Boswell, Lee, Lovel,
Loversedge, Allen, Mansfield, Glover, Williams, Carew, Martin, Stanley,
Berkley, Plunket, and Corrie. Mr. Borrow says: &#8220;The clans Young and
Smith, or Curraple, still haunt two of the eastern counties. The name Curraple
is a favourite among the English Gipsies. It means a smith&mdash;a name
very appropriate to a Gipsy. The root is <i>Curaw</i>, to strike, hammer, &amp;c.&#8221;
Among the English and Scottish Gipsies in America, I have found a great
variety of surnames.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote146" id="Footnote146"></a><a href="#FNanchor146"><span class="label">[146]</span></a> In the &#8220;Gipsies in Spain,&#8221; Mr. Borrow says: &#8220;Every family in England

<p><a name="Footnote147" id="Footnote147"></a><a href="#FNanchor147"><span class="label">[147]</span></a> It is known that the rock-raven, or <i>corbie</i>, seldom preys upon the flocks
around her nest; but the moment she is deprived of her young, she will,
to the utmost of her power, wreak her vengeance on the young lambs in
her immediate neighborhood. I have known the corbie, when bereaved of
her brood, tear, with her beak, the very foggage from the earth, and toss
it about; and before twenty-four hours elapsed, several lambs would fall
a sacrifice to her fury. I have also observed that grouse, where the
ground suits their breeding, are generally very plentiful close around the
eyrie of the relentless falcon.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote148" id="Footnote148"></a><a href="#FNanchor148"><span class="label">[148]</span></a> After recovery from child-birth, the Gipsy woman recommences her
course of begging or stealing, with her child in her arms; and then she is
more rapacious than at other times, taking whatever she can lay her hands
upon. For she calculates upon escaping without a beating, by holding up
her child to receive the blows aimed at her; which she knows will have
the effect of making the aggrieved person desist, till she finds an opportunity
of getting out of the way.&mdash;<i>Grellmann on the Hungarian Gipsies.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote149" id="Footnote149"></a><a href="#FNanchor149"><span class="label">[149]</span></a> The following facts will show what a Scottish Tinkler, at the present
day, will sometimes do in the way of &#8220;sorning,&#8221; or masterful begging.</p>

<p>One of the race paid a visit to the house of a country ale-wife, and, in a
crowded shop, vaulted the counter, and applied his bottle to her whiskey-tap.
Immediately a cry, with up-lifted hands, was raised for the police, but
the prudent ale-wife treated the circumstance with indifference, and exclaimed:
&#8220;Hout, tout, tout! <i>let</i> the deil tak&#8217; a wee drappie.&#8221;</p>

<p>On another occasion, a Gipsy woman entered a country public-house,
leaving her partner at a short distance from the door. Espying a drawn
bottle of porter, standing on a table, in a room in which were two females
sitting, she, without the least ceremony, filled a glass, and drank it off;
but before she could decant another, the other Gipsy, feeling sure of the
luck of his mate, from her being admitted into the premises, immediately
proceeded to share it with her. But he had hardly drank off the remainder
of the porter, ere a son of the mistress of the house made his appearance,
and demanded what was wanted. &#8220;Want&mdash;<i>want?</i>&#8221; replied the Gipsy, with
a leering eye towards the empty bottle; &#8220;we want nothing&mdash;we&#8217;ve got all
that we want!&#8221; On being ordered to &#8220;walk out of that,&#8221; they left, with a
smile of satisfaction playing on their weather-beaten countenances.</p>

<p>Such displays of Gipsy impudence sometimes call forth only a hearty
laugh from the people affected by them.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

kept a great secret. <i>Page 206.</i></p>

<p><a name="Footnote151" id="Footnote151"></a><a href="#FNanchor151"><span class="label">[151]</span></a> Julius Serenus, says Stackhouse, tells us, that the method among the
Assyrians, Chaldeans, and Egyptians was to fill the cup with water, then
throw into it thin plates of gold and silver, together with some precious
stones, whereon were engraven certain characters, and, after that, the person
who came to consult the oracle used certain forms of incantation, and,
so calling upon the devil, were wont to receive their answer several ways:
sometimes by particular sounds; sometimes by the characters which were
in the cup rising upon the surface of the water, and by their arrangement
forming the answer; and many times by the visible appearance of the persons
themselves, about whom the oracle was consulted. Cornelius Agrippa
(De Occult. Philos. LI, c. 57,) tells as, likewise, that the manner of some was
to pour melted wax into the cup wherein was water; which wax would
range itself in order, and so form answers, according to the questions proposed.&mdash;<i>Saurin&#8217;s

<p><a name="Footnote155" id="Footnote155"></a><a href="#FNanchor155"><span class="label">[155]</span></a> According to Grellmann, working in iron is the most usual occupation
of the Gipsies. In Hungary it is so common, as to have given rise
to the proverb, &#8220;So many Gipsies, so many smiths.&#8221; The same may be
said of those in Transylvania, Wallachia, and Moldavia, and all Turkey in
Europe; at least, Gipsies following that occupation are very numerous in
those countries.</p>

<p>This occupation seems to have been a favourite one with them, from the
most distant period. Uladislaus, King of Hungary, in the year 1496, ordered:
&#8220;That every officer and subject, of whatever rank or condition, do
allow Thomas Polgar, leader of twenty-five tents of wandering Gipsies, free
residence everywhere, and on no account to molest either him or his
people, because they prepared musket balls and other military stores, for
the Bishop Sigismund, at F&uuml;nf-kirchen.&#8221; In the year 1565, when Mustapa,
Turkish Regent of Bosnia, besieged Crupa, the Turks having expended
their powder and cannon balls, the Gipsies were employed to make
the latter, part of iron, the rest of stone, cased with lead.</p>

<p>Observe the Gipsies at whatever employment you may, there always
appear sparks of genius. We cannot, indeed, help wondering, when we
consider the skill they display in preparing and bringing their work to
perfection, from the scarcity of proper tools and materials.&mdash;<i>Grellmann on

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>BORDER GIPSIES.</h3>

<p>It would be an unpardonable omission were I to overlook
the descendants of John Faw, &#8220;Lord and Earl of Little
Egypt,&#8221; in this history of the Gipsies in Scotland. But to
enter into details relative to many of the members of this
ancient clan, would be merely a repetition of actions, similar
in character to those already related of some of the other
bands in Scotland.</p>

<p>It would appear that the district in which the Faw tribe
commonly travelled, comprehended East Lothian, Berwickshire
and Roxburghshire; and that Northumberland was also
part of their walk. I can find no traces of Gipsies, of that
surname, having, in families, traversed the midland or western
parts of the south of Scotland, for nearly the last seventy
years; and almost all the few ancient public documents
relative to this clan seem to imply that they occupied the
counties above mentioned.</p>

<p>I am inclined to believe that the Faws and the Baillies,
the two principal Gipsy clans in Scotland, had frequently
lived in a state of hostility with one another. These two
tribes quarrelled in the reign of James V, when they
brought their dispute before the king in council; and from
the renewal of the order in council, in the reign of Queen
Mary, it appears their animosities had then existed. In the
year 1677, the Faws and the Shaws, as already noticed,
advanced into Tweed-dale, to fight the Baillies and the
Browns, as mentioned by Dr. Pennecuik, in his history of
Tweed-dale. At the present day, the Baillies consider
themselves quite superior in rank to the Faas; and, on the
other hand, the Faas and their friends speak with great
bitterness and contempt of the Baillies, calling them &#8220;a
parcel of thieves and vagabonds.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor156" id="FNanchor156"></a><a href="#Footnote156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>In Ruddiman&#8217;s Weekly Magazine, of the 4th August, 1774,
the following notice is taken of this tribe, which shows the
fear which persons of respectability entertained for them:
&#8220;The descendants of this Lord of Little Egypt continued to
travel about in Scotland till the beginning of this century,
mostly about the southern Border; and I am most credibly
informed that one, Henry Faa, was received, and ate at the
tables of people in public office, and that men of considerable
fortune paid him a gratuity, called blackmail, in order to
have their goods protected from thieves.&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the Faas rose to great eminence in the mercantile
world, and was connected by marriage with Scotch families
of the rank of baronets. This family was the highly respectable
one of Fall, now extinct, general merchants in Dunbar,
who were originally members of the Gipsy family at
Yetholm. So far back as about the year 1670, one of the
baillies of Dunbar was of the surname of Faa, spelled exactly
as the Gipsy name, as appears by the Rev. J. Blackadder&#8217;s
Memoirs. On the 18th of May, 1734, Captain James Fall,
of Dunbar, was elected member of parliament for the Dunbar
district of burghs. On the 28th of May, 1741, Captain Fall
was again elected member for the same burghs; but, there
being a double return, Sir Hew Dalrymple ousted him. The
family of Fall gave Dunbar provosts and baillies, and ruled
the political interests of that burgh for many years. When
hearty over their cups, they often mentioned their origin;
and, to perpetuate the memory of their descent from the
family of Faa, at Yetholm, the late Mrs. Fall, of Dunbar,
whose husband was provost of the town, had the whole
family, with their asses, &amp;c., &amp;c., as they took their departure
from Yetholm, represented, by herself, in needle-work, or
tapestry.<a name="FNanchor157" id="FNanchor157"></a><a href="#Footnote157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> The particulars, or details, of this family group<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
were derived from her husband, who had the facts from his
grandfather, one of the individuals represented in the piece.
A respectable aged gentleman, yet living in Dunbar, has
often seen this family piece of the Falls, and had its details
pointed out and explained to him by Mrs. Fall herself.<a name="FNanchor158" id="FNanchor158"></a><a href="#Footnote158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>The mercantile house of the Falls, at Dunbar, was so extensive
as to have many connexions in the ports of the Baltic
and Mediterranean, and supported so high a character that
several of the best families in Scotland sent their sons to it,
to be initiated in the mysteries of commerce. Amongst
others who were bred merchants by the Falls, were Sir
Francis Kinloch, and two sons of Sir John Anstruther. It
appears that the Falls were most honourable men in all their
transactions; and that the cause of the ruin of their eminent
firm was the failure of some considerable mercantile houses
who were deeply indebted to them.</p>

<p>One of the Misses Fall was married to Sir John Anstruther,
of Elie, baronet. It appears that this alliance with
the family of Fall was not relished by the friends of Sir
John, of his own class in society. The consequence was
that Lady Anstruther was not so much respected, and did
not receive those attentions from her neighbours, to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
her rank, as Sir John&#8217;s wife, gave her a title. The tradition
of her Gipsy descent was fresh in the memories of those in
the vicinity of her residence; and she frequently got no
other name, or title, when spoken of, than &#8220;Jenny Faa.&#8221;
She was, however, a woman of great spirit and activity.
Her likeness was taken, and, I believe, is still preserved by
the family of Anstruther.<a name="FNanchor159" id="FNanchor159"></a><a href="#Footnote159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>At a contested election, for a member of parliament, for
the burghs in the east of Fife, in which Sir John was a candidate,
his opponents thought to annoy him, and his active
lady, by reference to the Gipsy origin of the latter. Whenever
Lady Anstruther entered the burghs, during the canvass,
the streets resounded with the old song of the &#8220;Gipsy
Laddie.&#8221; A female stepped up to her ladyship, and expressed
her sorrow at the rabble singing the song in her presence.
&#8220;Oh, never mind them,&#8221; replied Lady Anstruther; &#8220;they are
only repeating what they hear from their parents.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor160" id="FNanchor160"></a><a href="#Footnote160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> The
following is the song alluded to:</p>

</div></div>

<p>Tradition states that John Faa, the leader of a band of
Gipsies, seizing the opportunity of the Earl of Cassilis&#8217; absence,
on a deputation to the Assembly of divines at Westminster,
in 1643, to ratify the solemn league and covenant,
carried off the lady. The Earl was considered a sullen and
ill-tempered man, and perhaps not a very agreeable companion
to his lady.<a name="FNanchor161" id="FNanchor161"></a><a href="#Footnote161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>Before proceeding to give an account of the modern Gipsies
on the Scottish Border, I shall transcribe an interesting
note which Sir Walter Scott gave to the public, in explaining
the origin of that singular character Meg Merrilies, in
the novel Guy Mannering. The illustrious author kindly
offered me the &#8220;scraps&#8221; which he had already given to
Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine, to incorporate them, if I chose, in
my history of the Gipsies; but I prefer giving them in his
own words.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father,&#8221; says Sir Walter, &#8220;remembered Jean Gordon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
of Yetholm, who had a great sway among her tribe.
She was quite a Meg Merrilies, and possessed the savage
virtue of fidelity in the same perfection. Having been hospitably
received at the farm-house of Lochside, near Yetholm,
she had carefully abstained from committing any depredations
on the farmer&#8217;s property. But her sons, (nine in
number,) had not, it seems, the same delicacy, and stole a
brood-sow from their kind entertainer. Jean was so much
mortified at this ungrateful conduct, and so much ashamed
of it, that she absented herself from Lochside for several
years. At length, in consequence of some temporary pecuniary
necessity, the good-man of Lochside was obliged to go
to Newcastle, to get some money to pay his rent. Returning
through the mountains of Cheviot, he was benighted,
and lost his way. A light, glimmering through the window
of a large waste-barn, which had survived the farm-house to
which it had once belonged, guided him to a place of shelter;
and when he knocked at the door, it was opened by
Jean Gordon. Her very remarkable figure, for she was
nearly six feet high, and her equally remarkable features
and dress, rendered it impossible to mistake her for a moment;
and to meet with such a character, in so solitary a
place, and probably at no great distance from her clan, was
a terrible surprise to the poor man, whose rent, (to lose
which would have been ruin to him,) was about his person.
Jean set up a loud shout of joyful recognition. &#8216;Eh, sirs!
the winsome gude-man of Lochside! Light down, light
down; for ye manna gang farther the night, and a friend&#8217;s
house sae near!&#8217; The farmer was obliged to dismount, and
accept of the Gipsy&#8217;s offer of supper and a bed. There was
plenty of meat in the barn, however it might be come by,
and preparations were going on for a plentiful supper, which
the farmer, to the great encrease of his anxiety, observed
was calculated for ten or twelve guests of the same description,
no doubt, with his landlady. Jean left him in no doubt
on the subject. She brought up the story of the stolen sow,
and noticed how much pain and vexation it had given her.
Like other philosophers, she remarked that the world grows
worse daily, and, like other parents, that the bairns got out
of her guiding, and neglected the old Gipsy regulations
which commanded them to respect, in their depredations, the
property of their benefactors. The end of all this was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
enquiry what money the farmer had about him, and an urgent
request that he would make her his purse-keeper, as
the bairns, as she called her sons, would be soon home. The
poor farmer made a virtue of necessity, told his story, and
surrendered his gold to Jean&#8217;s custody. She made him put
a few shillings in his pocket; observing it would excite suspicion
should he be found travelling altogether penniless.
This arrangement being made, the farmer lay down on a
sort of <i>shake-down</i>, as the Scotch call it, upon some straw;
but, as is easily to be believed, slept not. About midnight
the gang returned with various articles of plunder, and
talked over their exploits, in language which made the farmer
tremble. They were not long in discovering their
guest, and demanded of Jean whom she had got there.
&#8216;E&#8217;en the winsome gude-man of Lochside, poor boy,&#8217; replied
Jean; &#8216;he&#8217;s been at Newcastle, seeking siller to pay his rent,
honest man, but deil-be-licket he&#8217;s been able to gather in;
and sae he&#8217;s gaun e&#8217;en hame wi&#8217; a toom purse and a sair
heart.&#8217; &#8216;That may be, Jean,&#8217; replied one of the banditti,
&#8216;but we maun ripe his pouches a bit, and see if it be true or
no.&#8217; Jean set up her throat in exclamation against this
breach of hospitality, but without producing any change of
their determination. The farmer soon heard their stifled
whispers and light steps by his bed-side, and understood
they were rummaging his clothes. When they found the
money which the prudence of Jean Gordon had made him
retain, they held a consultation if they should take it or not;
but the smallness of the booty, and the vehemence of Jean&#8217;s
remonstrances, determined them on the negative. They
caroused, and went to rest. So soon as day dawned, Jean
roused her guest, produced his horse, which she had accommodated
behind the <i>hallan</i>, and guided him for some miles,
till he was on the high-road to Lochside. She then restored
his whole property, nor could his earnest entreaties prevail
on her to accept so much as a single guinea.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard the old people at Jedburgh say that all
Jean&#8217;s sons were condemned to die there on the same day.
It is said the jury were equally divided, but that a friend of
justice, who had slept during the whole discussion, waked
suddenly, and gave his vote for condemnation, in the emphatic
words: &#8216;Hang them a&#8217;.&#8217; Jean was present, and
only said, &#8216;The Lord help the innocent in a day like this.&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
Her own death was accompanied with circumstances of
brutal outrage, of which poor Jean was, in many respects,
wholly undeserving. Jean had, among other demerits, or
merits, as you may choose to rank it, that of being a staunch
Jacobite. She chanced to be at Carlisle, upon a fair or
market day, soon after the year 1746, where she gave vent
to her political partiality, to the great offence of the rabble
in that city. Being zealous in their loyalty when there
was no danger, in proportion to the tameness with which
they had surrendered to the Highlanders, in 1745, they inflicted
upon poor Jean Gordon no slighter penalty than that
of ducking her to death in the Eden. It was an operation
of some time, for Jean was a stout woman, and, struggling
with her murderers, often got her head above water; and,
while she had voice left, continued to exclaim, at such intervals,
&#8216;Charlie yet! Charlie yet!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;When a child, and among the scenes which she frequented,
I have often heard these stories, and cried piteously
for poor Jean Gordon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before quitting the Border Gipsies, I may mention that
my grandfather, riding over Charter-house moor, then a very
extensive common, fell suddenly among a large band of
them, who were carousing in a hollow of the moor, surrounded
by bushes. They instantly seized on his horse&#8217;s
bridle, with many shouts of welcome, exclaiming, (for he
was well known to most of them,) that they had often dined
at his expense, and he must now stay, and share their good-cheer.
My ancestor was a little alarmed, for, like the good
man of Lochside, he had more money about his person than
he cared to venture with into such society. However, being
a bold, lively man, he entered into the humour of the
thing, and sate down to the feast, which consisted of all the
different varieties of game, poultry, pigs, and so forth, that
could be collected by a wide and indiscriminate system of
plunder. The feast was a very merry one, but my relative
got a hint, from some of the elder Gipsies, to retire just
when &#8216;The mirth and fun grew fast and furious;&#8217; and,
mounting his horse, accordingly, he took French leave
of his entertainers, but without experiencing the least
breach of hospitality. I believe Jean Gordon was at this
festival.</p>

<p>&#8220;The principal settlements of the Gipsies, in my time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
have been the two villages of Easter and Wester Gordon,
and what is called Kirk-Yetholm,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Making good the proverb odd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near the church and far from God.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In giving an account of the modern Gipsies on the Scottish
Border, I shall transcribe, at full length, the faithful
and interesting report of Baillie Smith, of Kelso, which was
published in Hoyland&#8217;s &#8220;Historical Survey of the Gipsies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A considerable time,&#8221; says Mr. Smith, &#8220;having elapsed
since I had an opportunity or occasion to attend to the
situation of the colony of Gipsies in our neighbourhood, I
was obliged to delay my answer to your enquiries, until I
could obtain more information respecting their present
numbers.</p>

<p>&#8220;The great bar to the benevolent intentions of improving
their situation, will be the impossibility to convince them
that there either is, or can be, a mode of life preferable, or
even equal, to their own.</p>

<p>&#8220;A strong spirit of independence, or what they would
distinguish by the name of liberty, runs through the whole
tribe. It is, no doubt, a very licentious liberty, but entirely
to their taste. Some kind of honour peculiar to themselves
seems to prevail in their community. They reckon it a disgrace
to steal near their homes, or even at a distance, if detected.
I must always except that petty theft of feeding
their <i>shelties</i> and asses, on the farmer&#8217;s grass and corn, which
they will do, whether at home or abroad.</p>

<p>&#8220;When avowedly trusted, even in money matters, they
never deceived me, nor forfeited their promise. I am sorry
to say, however, that when checked in their licentious appropriations,
&amp;c., they are very much addicted both to threaten
and to execute revenge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Having so far premised with respect to their general
conduct and character, I shall proceed to answer, as far as I
am able, the four queries subjoined to the circular which
you sent me; and then subjoin, in notes, some instances of
their conduct in particular cases, which may perhaps elucidate
their general disposition and character.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Query 1st.</i> What number of Gipsies in the county?</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Answer.</i> I know of none except the colony of Yetholm,
and one family who lately removed from that place to Kelso.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Yetholm consists of two towns, or large villages, called
Town-Yetholm and Kirk-Yetholm. The first is in the estate
of Mr. Wauchope, of Niddry; the latter in that of the
Marquis of Tweed-dale. The number of the Gipsy colony
at present in Kirk-Yetholm amounts to, at least, 109 men,
women and children; and perhaps two or three may have
escaped notice. They marry early in life; in general have
many children; and their number seems to be encreasing.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Query 2d.</i> In what do the men and women mostly employ
themselves?</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Answer.</i> I have known the colony between forty and
fifty years. At my first remembrance of them, they were
called the <i>Tinklers</i> (Tinkers) of Yetholm, from the males
being chiefly then employed in mending pots and other culinary
utensils, especially in their peregrinations through the
hilly and less frequented parts of the country. Sometimes
they were called <i>Horners</i>, from their occupation in making
and selling horn-spoons, called <i>cutties</i>. Now, their common
appellation is that of <i>Muggers</i>, or, what pleases them better,
<i>Potters</i>. They purchase, at a cheap rate, the cast or faulty
articles from the different manufacturers of earthenware, which
they carry for sale all over the country; consisting of groups
of six, ten, and sometimes twelve or fourteen persons, male
and female, young and old, provided with a horse and cart,
to transport the pottery, besides shelties and asses, to carry
the youngest of the children, and such baggage as they find
necessary. A few of the colony also employ themselves,
occasionally, in making besoms, foot-basses, &amp;c., from heath,
broom, and bent, and sell them at Kelso and the neighbouring
towns. After all, their employment can be considered
little better than an apology for idleness and vagrancy. I
do not see that the women are otherwise employed than
attending the young children, and assisting to sell the pottery
when carried through the country.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are, in general, great adepts in hunting, shooting
and fishing; in which last they use the net and spear,
as well as the rod; and often supply themselves with
a hearty meal by their dexterity. They have no notion of
being limited in their field sports, either in time, place, or
mode of destruction. In the country, they sleep in barns
and byres, or other out-houses; and when they cannot find
that accommodation, they take the canvas covering from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
pottery cart and squat below it, like a covey of partridges
in the snow.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Query 3d.</i> Have they any settled abode in winter, and
where?</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Answer.</i> Their residence, with the exception of a single
family, who, some years ago, came to Kelso, is at Kirk-Yetholm,
and chiefly confined to one row of houses, or
street, of that town, which goes by the name of the <i>Tinkler
Row</i>. Most of them have leases of their possessions,
granted for a term of nineteen times nineteen years, for payment
of a small sum yearly, something of the nature of a
quit-rent. There is no tradition in the neighbourhood concerning
the time when the Gipsies first took up their residence
at that place, nor whence they came. Most of their
leases, I believe, were granted by the family of the Bennets,
of Grubit, the last of whom was Sir David Bennet, who died
about sixty years ago. The late Mr. Nisbet, of Dirlton,
then succeeded to the estate, comprehending the baronies
of Kirk-Yetholm and Grubit. He died about the year
1783; and long after, the property was acquired by the late
Lord Tweed-dale&#8217;s trustees. During the latter part of the
life of the late Mr. Nisbet, he was less frequently at his
estate in Roxburghshire than formerly. He was a great
favourite of the Gipsies, and was in use to call them his
body-guards, and often gave them money, &amp;c.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the other hand, both the late and present Mr. Wauchope
were of opinion that the example of these people had
a bad effect upon the morals and industry of the neighbourhood;
and seeing no prospect of their removal, and as little
of their reformation, considered it as a duty to the public
to prevent the evil encreasing; and never would consent to
any of the colony taking up their residence in <i>Town</i> Yetholm.</p>

<p>&#8220;They mostly remain at home during winter, but as soon
as the weather becomes tolerably mild, in spring, most of
them, men, women and children, set out on their peregrinations
over the country; and live in a state of vagrancy, until
driven into their habitations by the approach of winter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seeming to pride themselves as a separate tribe, they
very seldom intermarry out of the colony; and, in rare instances,
when that happens, the Gipsy, whether male or
female, by influence and example, always induces the stranger
husband, or wife, to adopt the manners of the colony; so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
that no improvement is ever obtained in that way. The
progeny of such alliances have almost universally the tawny
complexion, and fine black eyes, of the Gipsy parent, whether
father or mother. So strongly remarkable is the Gipsy cast
of countenance, that even a description of them to a stranger,
who has had no opportunity of formerly seeing them, will
enable him to know them whenever he meets them. Some
individuals, but very rarely, separate from the colony altogether;
and when they do so, early in life, and go to a distance,
such as London, or even Edinburgh, their acquaintances
in the country get favourable accounts of them. A
few betake themselves to regular and constant employments
at home, but soon tire, and return to their old way of life.</p>

<p>&#8220;When any of them, especially a leader, or man of influence,
dies, they have full meetings, not only of the colony,
but of the Gipsies from a distance; and those meetings, or
<i>late-wakes</i>, are by no means conducted with sobriety or
decency.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Query 4th.</i> Are any of their children taught to read, and
what portion of them? With any anecdotes respecting
their customs and conduct.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Answer.</i> Education being obtained at a cheaper rate,
the Gipsies, in general, give their male children as good a
one as is bestowed on those of the labouring people, and
farm servants, in the neighbourhood; such as reading, writing,
and the first principles of arithmetic. They all apply
to the clergyman of the parish for baptism to their children;
and a strong, superstitious notion universally prevails with
them, that it is unlucky to have an unchristened child in the
house. Only a very few ever attend divine service, and
those as seldom as they can, just to prevent being refused as
sponsors at their children&#8217;s baptism.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are, in general, active and lively, particularly when
engaged in field sports, or in such temporary pursuits as are
agreeable to their habits and dispositions; but are destitute
of the perseverance necessary for a settled occupation, or
even for finishing what a moderate degree of continued
labour would enable them to accomplish in a few weeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember that, about 45 years ago, being then apprenticed
to a writer, who was in use to receive the rents and
the small duties of Kirk-Yetholm, he sent me there with a
list of names, and a statement of what was due, recommending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
me apply to the landlord of the public-house, in the
village, for any information or assistance which I might
need.</p>

<p>&#8220;After waiting a long time, and receiving payment from
most of the feuers, or rentalers, I observed to him, that none
of the persons of the names of Faa, Young, Blythe, Fluckie,
&amp;c., who stood at the bottom of the list, for small sums, had
come to meet me, according to the notice given by the baron-officer,
and proposed sending to inform them that they were
detaining me, and to request their immediate attendance.</p>

<p>&#8220;The landlord, with a grave face, enquired whether my
master had desired me to ask money from those men. I
said, not particularly; but they stood on the list. &#8216;So I
see,&#8217; said the landlord; &#8216;but had your master been here himself,
he did not dare to ask money from them, either as rent
or feu duty. He knows that it is as good as if it were in
his pocket. They will pay when their own time comes, but
do not like to pay at a set time, with the rest of the barony,
and still less to be craved.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I accordingly returned without their money, and reported
progress. I found that the landlord was right: my master
said, with a smile, that it was unnecessary to send to them,
after the previous notice from the baron-officer; it was
enough if I had received the money, if offered. Their rent
and feu duty was brought to the office in a few weeks.
I need scarcely add that those persons all belonged to the
tribe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another instance of their licentious, independent spirit
occurs to me. The family of Niddry always gave a decent
annual remuneration to a baron-baillie, for the purpose of
keeping good order within the barony of Town-Yetholm.
The person whom I remember first in possession of that
office was an old man, called Doctor Walker, from his being
also the village surgeon; and from him I had the following
anecdote:</p>

<p>&#8220;Between Yetholm and the Border farms, in Northumberland,
there were formerly, as in most Border situations,
some uncultivated lands, called the Plea-lands, or Debatable-lands,
the pasturage of which was generally eaten up
by the sorners and vagabonds, on both sides of the marches.
Many years ago, Lord Tankerville and some others of the
English Borderers made their request to Sir David Bennet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
and the late Mr. Wauchope, of Niddry, that they would accompany
them at a riding of the Plea-lands, who readily
complied with their request. They were induced to this, as
they understood that the Gipsies had taken offence, on the
supposition that they might be circumscribed in the pasturage
for their shelties and asses, which they had held a long
time, partly by stealth, and partly by violence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Both threats and entreaties were employed to keep them
away; and, at last, Sir David obtained a promise from some
of the heads of the gang, that none of them should show
their faces on the occasion. They, however, got upon the
hills, at a little distance, whence they could see everything
that passed. At first they were very quiet. But when
they saw the English court-book spread out, on a cushion,
before the clerk, and apparently him taking in a line of
direction, interfering with what they considered to be their
privileged ground, it was with great difficulty that the most
moderate of them could restrain the rest from running down
and taking vengeance, even in sight of their own lord of the
manor.</p>

<p>&#8220;They only abstained for a short time; and no sooner
had Sir David and the other gentlemen taken leave of each
other, in the most polite and friendly manner, as Border
chiefs were wont to do, since Border feuds ceased, and had
departed to a sufficient distance, than the clan, armed with
bludgeons, pitchforks, and such other hostile weapons as
they could find, rushed down in a body, and before the chiefs
on either side had reached their home, there was neither
English tenant, horse, cow nor sheep left upon the premises.</p>

<p>&#8220;Meeting at Kelso, with Mr. Walter Scott, whose discriminating
habits and just observations I had occasion to
know, from his youth, and, at the same time, seeing one of
my Yetholm friends in the horse-market, I said to Mr. Scott,
&#8216;Try to get before that man with the long drab coat, look
at him on your return, and tell me whether you ever saw
him, and what you think of him.&#8217; He was as good as to indulge
me; and, rejoining me, he said, without hesitation:
&#8216;I never saw the man that I know of; but he is one of the
Gipsies of Yetholm, that you told me of, several years ago.&#8217;
I need scarcely say that he was perfectly correct.</p>

<p>&#8220;When first I knew anything about the colony, old Will
Faa was king, or leader; and had held the sovereignty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
for many years. The descendants of Faa now take the
name of Fall, from the Messrs. Fall, of Dunbar, who, they
pride themselves in saying, are of the same stock and lineage.
When old Will Faa was upwards of eighty years of
age, he called on me, at Kelso, on his way to Edinburgh,
telling me that he was going to see the laird, the late Mr.
Nisbet, of Dirlton, as he understood that he was very unwell;
and he himself being now old, and not so stout as he had
been, he wished to see him once more before he died. He
set out by the nearest road, which was by no means his common
practice. Next market-day, some of the farmers informed
me that they had been in Edinburgh, and seen Will
Faa, upon the bridge, (the south bridge was not then built;)
that he was tossing about his old brown hat, and huzzaing,
with great vociferation, that he had seen the laird before he
died. Indeed, Will himself had no time to lose; for, having
set his face homewards, by the way of the sea-coast, to vary
his route, as is the general custom of the gang, he only got
the length of Coldingham, when he was taken ill and died.</p>

<p>&#8220;His death being notified to his friends at Yetholm, they
and their acquaintances at Berwick, Spittal, Horncliff, &amp;c.,
met to pay the last honours to their old leader. His obsequies
were continued three successive days and nights, and
afterwards repeated at Yetholm, whither he was brought. I
cannot say that the funeral rites were celebrated with decency
and sobriety, for that was by no means the case. This
happened in the year 1783, or 1784, and the late Mr. Nisbet
did not long survive.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor162" id="FNanchor162"></a><a href="#Footnote162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>In addition to the above graphic report of Baillie Smith,
I will now give a few details from a MS., given to me by
Mr. Blackwood, towards the elucidation of the history of
the Gipsies. This MS. bears the initials of A. W., and appears
to have been written by a gentleman who had ample
opportunities of observing the manners of the Border Gipsies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>&#8220;I am a native of Yetholm parish, and a residenter in it,
with a little exception, for upwards of fifty years. I well
remember Kirk-Yetholm, when the Faas and Youngs
alone had a footing in it.<a name="FNanchor163" id="FNanchor163"></a><a href="#Footnote163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> The Taits came next, and latterly,
at various periods, the Douglasses, Blyths, Montgomerys,
&amp;c. Old William Faa, (with whom I was well acquainted,
and saw him married to his third wife,<a name="FNanchor164" id="FNanchor164"></a><a href="#Footnote164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>) constantly
claimed kindred with the Falls of Dunbar; and persisted,
to the last, that he himself was the male descendant,
in a direct line, from the Earl of Little Egypt. For many
years before his death, Mr. Nisbet of Dirlton, (the then laird
of Kirk-Yetholm,) gave him the charge of his house, at
Marlfield, and all its furniture, although he resided six miles
distant from it. The key of the principal door was regularly
delivered to him, at the laird&#8217;s departure. I remember
a sale of wood at Cherry-trees, belonging to the late Sheriff
Murray. William Faa was a purchaser at the roup, and
the sheriff proclaimed aloud to the clerk, that he would be
Mr. Faa&#8217;s cautioner. All the Tinklers in the village, and
even strangers resorting thither, considered William Faa
as the head and leader of the whole. His corpse was escorted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
betwixt Coldstream and Yetholm by above three
hundred asses.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was succeeded by his eldest son William, one of the
cleverest fellows upon the Border. For agility of person,
and dexterity in every athletic exercise, he had rarely met
with a competitor. He had a younger brother impressed,
when almost a boy. He deserted from his ship, in India;
enlisted as a soldier, and, by dint of merit, acquired a commission
in a regular regiment of foot, and died a lieutenant,
within these thirty years, at London. He was an officer under
Governor Wall, at Goree, when he committed the crime
for which he suffered, twenty years after, in England.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the present William Faa that the &#8216;Earl of
Hell&#8217; contended with; not for sovereignty, but to revenge
some ancient animosity.<a name="FNanchor165" id="FNanchor165"></a><a href="#Footnote165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> His lordship lives at New Coldstream,
and was the only person in Berwickshire that durst encounter,
in single combat, the renowned Bully-More. Young
fought three successive battles with Faa, and one desperate
engagement with More, midway between Dunse and
Coldstream; and was defeated in all of them. He is a
younger son of William Young, of Yetholm, the cotemporary
chieftain of old William Faa. It was still a younger
brother that migrated to Kelso, where he supported a good
character till he died. Charles Young, the eldest brother, is
still alive, and chief of the name. The following anecdote of
him will serve to establish his activity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Walker, of Thirkstane, the only residing heritor in
Yetholm parish, missed a valuable mare, upon a Sunday
morning. After many fruitless enquiries, at the adjacent
kirks and neighbourhood, he dispatched a servant for
Charles, in the evening. He privately communicated to him
his loss, and added, that he was fully persuaded he could
be the means of recovering the mare. Charles boldly answered,
&#8216;If she was betwixt the Tyne and the Forth, she
should be restored.&#8217; On the Thursday after, at sunrise, the
mare was found standing at the stable door, much jaded, and
very warm.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the Kirk-Yetholm families differed among themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
(and terrible conflicts at times they had,) this same
Mr. Walker was often chosen sole arbitrator, to decide their
differences. He has often been locked up in their houses
for twenty-four hours together, but carefully concealed their
secrets.<a name="FNanchor166" id="FNanchor166"></a><a href="#Footnote166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;The Yetholm Tinklers keep up an intercourse with their
friends at Horncliff, Spittal, Rothbury, Hexam, and Harbottle.
They go frequently to Newcastle, and even to Staffordshire,
for earthenware, and the whole family embark in
every expedition.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was at school with most of the present generation of
Tinklers. I mean the males; for, to speak truth, I never
heard of a female Gipsy being educated at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;None of this colony have been either impeached or tried
for a crime for fifty years past. Two Tinklers have been
executed at Jedburgh, in my remembrance, named Keith and
Clark, for murder and horse-stealing. They were strangers,
from a distance.&#8221;</p>

<p>When I visited Yetholm, I fell in with a gentleman who
resided at that time in Town-Yetholm. I chanced to mention
to him that I was sure all the Gipsies had a method of
their own in handling the cudgel, but he would not believe
it. At my request, he took me into some of their houses,
and, observing an old, rusty sword lying upon the joists of
an apartment in which we were sitting, I took it down, and,
under pretence of handling it, in their fashion, gave some of
the guards of the Hungarian sword-exercise. An old Gipsy,
of the name of Blyth, shook his head, and observed: &#8220;Ay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
that is an art easily carried about with you; it may be of
service to you some day.&#8221; My friend was then convinced
of his mistake.</p>

<p>William Faa, when I was in his house, showed me the
mark of a stroke of a sword on his right wrist, by which he
had nearly lost his hand. With others of his clan, he had
been engaged in a smuggling speculation, on the coast of
Northumberland, when they were overtaken by a party of
dragoons, one of whom singled out and attempted to take
Faa prisoner. William was armed with a stick only, but,
with his stick in his dexterous hand, he, for a long time, set
the dragoon, with all his arms, at defiance. The horseman,
now galloping round and round him, attempting to capture
him, became exasperated at the resistance of a man on foot,
armed with a cudgel only, and struck with such vigour that
the cudgel became shattered, and cut in pieces, till nothing
but a few inches of it remained. Still holding up the stump,
to meet the stroke of his antagonist&#8217;s sword, William was
cut to the bone, and compelled to yield himself a prisoner.
A person, present at the scuffle, informed me that the only
remark the brave Tinkler made to the dragoon was, &#8220;Ye&#8217;ve
spoiled a good fiddler.&#8221;</p>

<p>William Faa, the lineal descendant of John Faw, &#8220;Lord
and Earl of Little Egypt,&#8221; when I saw him, appeared about
sixty years of age, and was tall and genteel-looking, with
grey hair, and dark eyes. He is the individual who fought
the three battles with Young, between Dunse and Coldstream.
The following notice of his death I have extracted
from the &#8220;Scotsman&#8221; newspaper, of the 20th October, 1847:</p>

<p><a name="Footnote156" id="Footnote156"></a><a href="#FNanchor156"><span class="label">[156]</span></a> This long standing feud between the Baillies and the Faas is notorious.
In paying a visit to a family of English Gipsies in the United States, the
head of the family said to me: &#8220;You must really excuse us to-day. It&#8217;s
the Faas and Baillies over again; it will be all I can do to keep them from
coming to blows.&#8221; The noise inside of the house was frightful. There had
been a &#8220;difficulty&#8221; between two families in consequence of some gossip about
one of the parties before marriage, which the families were sifting to the
bottom.</p>

<p>The Faas and their partisans, on reading this work, will not overwell
relish the prominence given to the Baillie clan.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote157" id="Footnote157"></a><a href="#FNanchor157"><span class="label">[157]</span></a> &#8220;He will be pleased to learn that there is, in the house of Provost Whyte,
of Kirkaldy, a piece of needle-work, or tapestry, on which is depicted, by
the hands of Mrs. Fall, the principal events in the life of the founder of her
family, from the day the Gipsy child came to Dunbar in its mother&#8217;s creel,
until the same Gipsy child had become, by its own honourable exertions, the
head of the first mercantile establishment then existing in Scotland.&#8221; [This
seems to be an extract from a letter. The authority has been omitted in
the MS.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p><a name="Footnote158" id="Footnote158"></a><a href="#FNanchor158"><span class="label">[158]</span></a> &#8220;There are,&#8221; says a correspondent, &#8220;several gentlemen in this town and
neighbourhood who have heard declare, that the Falls themselves had often
acknowledged to them their descent from the Gipsy Faas. I am told by
an old Berwickshire gentlemen, who had the account from his mother, that
the Falls, on their departure from Yetholm, stopped some little time at a
country village-hamlet called Hume, in Berwickshire, where they had some
female relations; and after a few days spent there, they set out for Dunbar,
taking their female friends along with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Latterly, the late Robert and Charles Fall, who were cousins, kept separate
establishments. Robert possessed the dwelling house now occupied
by Lord Lauderdale; and Charles possessed one at the shore, (now the
custom-house.) built on the spot where some old houses formerly stood, and
was called &#8216;Lousy Law.&#8217; It was in these old cot-houses that the Falls
first took up their residence on coming to Dunbar. It appears the mother
of the first of the Falls who came to Dunbar was a woman of much spirit
and great activity. Old William Faa, the chief of the Gipsies at Yetholm,
when in Lothian, never failed to visit the Dunbar family, as his relations.
The Dunbar Falls were connected, by marriage, with the Anstruthers,
Footies, of Balgonie, Coutts, now bankers, and with Collector Whyte, of the
customs, at Kirkaldy, and Collector Melville, of the customs, at Dunbar.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote159" id="Footnote159"></a><a href="#FNanchor159"><span class="label">[159]</span></a> Speaking of a gentlemen in his autobiography, Dr. Alexander Carlyle,
in 1744. says: &#8220;He had the celebrated Jenny Fall, (afterwards Lady Anstruther,)
a coquette and a beauty, for months together in the house with
him; and as his person and manners drew the marked attention of the
ladies, he derived considerable improvement from the constant intercourse
with this young lady and her companions, for she was lively and clever,
no less than beautiful.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote160" id="Footnote160"></a><a href="#FNanchor160"><span class="label">[160]</span></a> I beg the reader to take particular notice of this circumstance. A
Scotch rabble is the lowest and meanest of all rabbles, at such work as
this. In their eyes, it was unpardonable that Lady Anstruther, or &#8220;Jenny
Faa,&#8221; should have been of Gipsy origin; but it would have horrified them,
had they known the meaning of her ladyship &#8220;being of Gipsy origin,&#8221; and
that she doubtless &#8220;chattered Gipsy,&#8221; like others of her tribe.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote161" id="Footnote161"></a><a href="#FNanchor161"><span class="label">[161]</span></a> See <a href="#Page_108">page 108</a>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote162" id="Footnote162"></a><a href="#FNanchor162"><span class="label">[162]</span></a> When Mr. Hoyland commenced making enquiries into the condition of
the Gipsies, he addressed circulars to the sheriffs, for information. No less
than thirteen Scotch sheriffs reported, &#8220;No Gipsies within the county.&#8221;
A report of this kind was nearly as good as would be that of a cockney, as
to there being no <i>foxes</i> in the country; because, while riding through it, on
the stage, he did not <i>see</i> any! Baillie Smith&#8217;s report, although graphic, is
superficial. He states that the Gipsies &#8220;marry early in life, and in general
have many children;&#8221; yet &#8220;that their number <i>seems</i> to be encreasing.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote163" id="Footnote163"></a><a href="#FNanchor163"><span class="label">[163]</span></a> The tribe of Young have preserved the following tradition respecting
their first settlement in Yetholm: At a siege of the city of Namur, (date
unknown,) the laird of Kirk-Yetholm, of the ancient family of Bennets, of
Grubit and Marlfield, in attempting to mount a breach, at the head of his
company, was struck to the ground, and all his followers killed, or put to
flight, except a Gipsy, the ancestor of the Youngs, who resolutely defended
his master till he recovered his feet, and then, springing past him upon the
rampart, seized a flag which he put into his leader&#8217;s hand. The besieged
were struck with panic&mdash;the assailants rushed again to the breach&mdash;Namur
was taken, and Captain Bennet had the glory of the capture. On returning
to Scotland, the laird, out of gratitude to his faithful follower, settled
him and his family, (who had formerly been travelling tinkers and
heckle-makers,) in Kirk-Yetholm; and conferred upon them, and the Faas,
a fen of their cottages, for the space of nineteen times nineteen years;
which they still hold from the Marquis of Tweed-dale, the present proprietor
of the estate.&mdash;<i>Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote164" id="Footnote164"></a><a href="#FNanchor164"><span class="label">[164]</span></a> On solemn occasions, Will Faa assumed, in his way, all the stately
deportment of sovereignty. He had twenty-four children, and at each of
their christenings he appeared, dressed in his original wedding-robes. These
christenings were celebrated with no small parade. Twelve young handmaidens
were always present, as part of the family retinue, and for the purpose
of waiting on the numerous guests, who assembled to witness the ceremony,
or partake of the subsequent festivities. Besides Will&#8217;s Gipsy
associates, several of the neighbouring farmers and lairds, with whom he
was on terms of friendly intercourse, (among others, the Murrays, of Cherry-trees,)
used to attend these christenings.&mdash;<i>Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote165" id="Footnote165"></a><a href="#FNanchor165"><span class="label">[165]</span></a> This is in contradiction to the assertion, in Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine, that,
on the death of his father, a sort of civil war broke out among the Yetholm
Gipsies; and that the usurper of the regal office was dispossessed, after a
battle, by the subjects who adhered to the legitimate heir.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote166" id="Footnote166"></a><a href="#FNanchor166"><span class="label">[166]</span></a> There would appear to be something remarkable in the position which
this Mr. Walker held with the Gipsies. I know, from the best of authority,
that most of the people living in and about Yetholm are Gipsies, settled or
unsettled, civilized or uncivilized, educated or uneducated; and of one in
particular, who went under the title of &#8220;Lord Mayor of Yetholm.&#8221; He
is now dead. The above mentioned Mr. Walker was probably a relation
of Dr. Walker, mentioned by Baillie Smith, as the baron-baillie of Yetholm.
I notice in Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine, that one William Walker, a Gipsy, in
company with various Yetholm Gipsies, was indicted at Jedburgh, in
1714, for fire-raising, but was acquitted. The Walkers alluded to in the
text are very probably of the same family, settled, and raised in the world.
As I have just said, most of the people in and about Yetholm are Gipsies.
Gipsydom has even eaten its way in among the population round about
Yetholm. The Rev. Mr. Baird, in conducting the Scottish Church Mission
among the <i>travelling</i> Gipsies, hailing from Yetholm, doubtless encountered
many of them incog. But all this will be better understood by the reader
after he peruses the <a href="#Page_371">Disquisition</a> on the Gipsies.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote167" id="Footnote167"></a><a href="#FNanchor167"><span class="label">[167]</span></a> Will Faa had a brother, a house-carpenter, in New York, who survived
him a few years. He was considered a fine old man by those who knew
him. He left a family in an humble, but respectable, way of doing. The
Scottish Gipsy throne was occupied by another family of Gipsies, in consequence
of this family being &#8220;forth of Scotland.&#8221; There are a great many
Faas, under one name or other, scattered over the world.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE CEREMONIES.</h3>

<p>The Gipsies in Scotland are all married at a very early
age. I do not recollect ever having seen or heard of them,
male or female, being unmarried, after they were twenty
years old. There are few instances of bastard children
among them; indeed, they declare that their children are all
born in wedlock.<a name="FNanchor168" id="FNanchor168"></a><a href="#Footnote168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> I know, however, of one instance to the
contrary; and of the Gipsy being dreadfully punished for
seducing a young girl of his own tribe.</p>

<p>The brother of the female, who was pregnant, took upon
himself the task of chastising the offender. With a knife in his
hand, and at the dead hour of night, he went to the house
of the seducer. The first thing he did was deliberately to
sharpen his knife upon the stone posts of the door of the
man&#8217;s house; and then, in a gentle manner, tap at the door,
to bring out his victim. The unsuspecting man came to the
door, in his shirt, to see what was wanted; but the salutation
he received was the knife thrust into his body, and the
stabs repeated several times. The avenger of his sister&#8217;s
wrongs fled for a short while; the wounded Tinkler recovered,
and, to repair the injury he had done, made the girl
his wife. The occurrence took place in Mid-Lothian, about
twenty years ago. The name of the woman was Baillie, and
her husband, Tait.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>I have not been able to discover any peculiarity in the
manner of Gipsy courtships, except that a man, above sixty
years of age, affirmed to me that it was the universal custom,
among the tribe, not to give away in marriage the younger
daughter before the elder. In order to have this information
confirmed, I enquired of a female, herself one of eleven
sisters,<a name="FNanchor169" id="FNanchor169"></a><a href="#Footnote169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> if this custom really existed among her people. She
was, at first, averse, evidently from fear, to answer my
question directly, and even wished to conceal her descent.
But, at last, seeing nothing to apprehend from speaking
more freely, she said such was once the custom; and that it
had been the cause of many unhappy marriages. She said
she had often heard the old people speaking about the law
of not allowing the younger sister to be married before the
elder. She, however, would not admit of the existence of
the custom at the present day, but appeared quite well acquainted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
with it, and could have informed me fully of it,
had she been disposed to speak on the subject.</p>

<p>The exact parallel to this custom is to be found in the
Gentoo code of laws, translated by Halhed; wherein it is
made criminal for &#8220;a man to marry while his elder brother
remains unmarried; or when a man marries his daughter to
such a person; or where a man gives the younger sister in
marriage while the elder sister remains unmarried.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor170" id="FNanchor170"></a><a href="#Footnote170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> The
learned translator of the code considers this custom of the
Gentoos of the remotest antiquity, and compares it with that
passage in the Book of Genesis, where Laban excuses himself
to Jacob for having substituted Leah for Rachel, in
these words, &#8220;It must not be so done in our country, to give
the younger before the first-born.&#8221;</p>

<p>The nuptial ceremony of the Gipsies is undoubtedly of the
highest antiquity, and would, probably, be one of the first
marriage ceremonies observed by mankind, in the very first
stages of human society. When we consider the extraordinary
length of time the Gipsies have preserved their speech,
as a secret among themselves, in the midst of civilized society,
all over Europe, while their persons were proscribed and
hunted down in every country, like beasts of the chase, we
are not at all surprised at their retaining some of their ancient
customs; for these, as distinguished from their language,
are of easy preservation, under any circumstances in
which they may have been placed. That may much more
be said of this ceremony, as there would be an occasion for
its almost daily observance. It was wrapped up with their
very existence&mdash;the choice of their wives, and the love of their
offspring&mdash;the most important and interesting transactions
of their lives; and would, on that account, be one of the longest
observed, the least easily forgotten, of their ancient usages.</p>

<p>The nuptial rites of the Scottish Gipsies are, perhaps, unequalled
in the history of marriages. At least, I have neither
seen nor heard of any marriage ceremony that has the
slightest resemblance to it, except the extraordinary benediction
which our countryman, Mungo Park, received from
the bride at the Moorish wedding in Ali&#8217;s camp, at Benown;
and that of a certain custom practised by the Mandingoes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
at Kamalia, in Africa, also mentioned by Park.<a name="FNanchor171" id="FNanchor171"></a><a href="#Footnote171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> This custom
with the Mandingoes and the Gipsies is nearly the same
as that observed by the ancient Hebrews, in the days of
Moses, mentioned in the Book of Deuteronomy. When we
have the manners and customs of every savage tribe hitherto
discovered, including even the Hottentots and Abyssinians,
described, in grave publications, by adventurous travellers,
I can see no reason why there should not be preserved,
and exhibited for the inspection of the public, the manners
and customs of a barbarous race that have lived so long at
our own doors&mdash;one more interesting, in some respects, than
any yet discovered; and more particularly as marriage is a
very important, indeed the most important, institution among
the inhabitants of any country, whether civilized or in a
state of barbarism. How much would not our antiquarians
now value authenticated specimens of the language, manners,
and customs of the ancient Pictish nation that once
inhabited Scotland!</p>

<p>In describing the marriage ceremony of the Scottish Gipsies,
it is scarcely possible to clothe the curious facts in
language fit to be perused by every reader. But I must
adopt the sentiment of Sir Walter Scott, as given in the
<a href="#Page_55">Introduction</a>, and &#8220;not be squeamish about delicacies, where
knowledge is to be sifted out and acquired.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor172" id="FNanchor172"></a><a href="#Footnote172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>A marriage cup, or bowl, made out of solid wood, and of
a capacity to contain about two Scotch pints, or about one
gallon, is made use of at the ceremony. After the wedding-party
is assembled, and everything prepared for the occasion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the priest takes the bowl and gives it to the bride,
who passes urine into it; it is then handed, for a similar
purpose, to the bridegroom. After this, the priest takes a
quantity of earth from the ground, and throws it into the
bowl, adding sometimes a quantity of brandy to the mixture.
He then stirs the whole together, with a spoon made
of a ram&#8217;s horn, and sometimes with a large ram&#8217;s horn itself,
which he wears suspended from his neck by a string.
He then presents the bowl, with its contents, first to the
bride, and then to the bridegroom; calling at the same
time upon each to separate the mixture in the bowl, if they
can. The young couple are then ordered to join hands
over the bowl containing the earth, urine, and spirits; when
the priest, in an audible voice, and in the Gipsy language,
pronounces the parties to be husband and wife; and as none
can separate the mixture in the bowl, so they, in their persons,
cannot be separated till death dissolves their union.</p>

<p>As soon as that part of the ceremony is performed, the
couple undress, and repair to their nuptial couch. After
remaining there for a considerable time, some of the most
confidential relatives of the married couple are admitted
to the apartment, as witnesses to the virginity of the bride;
certain tokens being produced to the examining friends,
at this stage of the ceremony. If all the parties concerned
are satisfied, the bride receives a handsome present from the
friends, as a mark of their respect for her remaining chaste
till the hour of her marriage. This present is, in some instances,
a box of a particular construction.<a name="FNanchor173" id="FNanchor173"></a><a href="#Footnote173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>These matters being settled on the spot, the wedded pair
rise from the marriage-bed, again dress themselves in their
finest apparel, and again join the wedding-party. The joy
and happiness on all sides is now excessive. There is
nothing to be heard or seen but fiddling and piping, dancing,
feasting and drinking, which are kept up, with the utmost
spirit and hilarity imaginable, for many hours together.<a name="FNanchor174" id="FNanchor174"></a><a href="#Footnote174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>The nuptial mixture is carefully bottled up, and the bottle
marked with the Roman character, M. In this state, it is
buried in the earth, or kept in their houses or tents, and is
carefully preserved, as evidence of the marriage of the parties.
When it is buried in the fields, the husband and wife
to whom it belongs frequently repair to the spot, and look
at it, for the purpose of keeping them in remembrance of
their nuptial vows. Small quantities of the compound are
also given to individuals of the tribe, to be used for certain
rare purposes, such, perhaps, as pieces of the bride&#8217;s cake
are used for dreaming-bread, among the natives of Scotland,
at the present day.</p>

<p>What is meant by employing earth, water, spirits, and, of
course, air, in this ceremony, cannot be conjectured; unless
these ingredients may have some reference to the four elements
of nature&mdash;fire, air, earth, and water. That of using
a ram&#8217;s horn, in performing the nuptial rites, has also its
meaning, could information be obtained concerning that
part of the ceremony.</p>

<p>This marriage ceremony is observed by the Gipsies in
Scotland at the present day. A man, of the name of James
Robertson, and a girl, of the name of Margaret Graham,
were married, at Lochgellie, exactly in the manner described.
Besides the testimony of the Gipsies themselves, it is a
popular tradition, wherever these people have resided in
Scotland, that they were all married by mixing of earth and
urine together in a wooden bowl. I know of a girl, of about
sixteen years of age, having been married in the Gipsy
fashion, in a kiln, at Appindull, in Perthshire. A Gipsy informed
me that he was at a wedding of a couple on a moor
near Lochgellie, and that they were married in the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Gipsy manner described. Shortly after this, a pair were
married near Stirling, after the custom of their ancestors.
In this instance, a screen, made of an old blanket, was put
up in the open field, to prevent the parties seeing each
other, while furnishing the bowl with what was necessary
to lawfully constitute their marriage.<a name="FNanchor175" id="FNanchor175"></a><a href="#Footnote175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> The last-named
Gipsy further stated to me, that when two young folks of
the tribe agree to be married, the father of the bridegroom
sleeps with the bride&#8217;s mother, for three or four nights immediately
previous to the celebration of the marriage.</p>

<p>Having endeavoured to describe the ancient nuptial ceremony
of the Scottish Gipsies, I have considered it proper to
give some account of an individual who acted as priest on
such occasions. The name of a famous celebrator of Gipsy
marriages, in Fifeshire, was Peter Robertson, well known,
towards the latter end of his days, by the name of Blind
Pate. Peter was a tall, lean, dark man, and wore a large
cocked hat, of the olden fashion, with a long staff in his
hand. By all accounts, he must have been a hundred years
of age when he died. He was frequently seen at the head
of from twenty to forty Gipsies, and often travelled in the
midst of a crowd of women. Whenever a marriage was
determined on, among the Lochgellie horde, or their immediate
connexions, Peter was immediately sent for, however
far distant he happened to be at the time from the parties
requiring his assistance, to join them in wedlock: for he
was the oldest member of the tribe at the time, and head of
the Tinklers in the district, and, as the oldest member, it
was his prerogative to officiate, as priest, on such occasions.
A friend, who obligingly sent me some anecdotes of this
Gipsy priest, communicated to me the following facts regarding
him:</p>

<p>&#8220;At the wedding of a favourite Brae-laird, in the shire of
Kinross, Peter Robertson appeared at the head of a numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
band of Tinklers, attended by twenty-four asses. He
was always chief and spokesman for the band. At the wedding
of a William Low, a multerer, at Kinross, Peter, for
the last time, was seen, with upwards of twenty-three asses
in his retinue. He had certain immunities and privileges
allowed him by his tribe. For one thing, he had the sole
profits arising from the sale of keel, used in marking sheep,
in the neighbouring upland districts; and one of the asses
belonging to the band was always laden with this article
alone. Peter was also notorious as a physician, and administered
to his favourites medicines of his own preparation,
and numbers of extraordinary cures were ascribed to his
superior skill. He was possessed of a number of wise sayings,
a great many of which are still current in the country.
Peter Robertson was, altogether, a very shrewd and sensible
man, and no acts of theft were ever laid to his charge, that
I know of. He had, however, in his band, several females
who told fortunes. The ceremony of marriage which he
performed was the same you mentioned to me. The whole
contents of the bowl were stirred about with a large ram&#8217;s
horn, which was suspended from a string round his neck, as
a badge, I suppose, of his priestly office.<a name="FNanchor176" id="FNanchor176"></a><a href="#Footnote176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> He attended all
the fairs and weddings for many miles round. The
Braes of Kinross were his favourite haunt; so much so
that, in making his settlement, and portioning his children,
he allowed them all districts, in the country round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
about, to travel in; but he reserved the Braes of Kinross as
his own pendicle, and hence our favourite toast in the shire
of Kinross, &#8216;The lasses of Blind Pate&#8217;s Pendicle.&#8217; Besides
the Braes of Kinross, this Gipsy, in his sweeping verbal testament,
reserved the town of Dunfermline, also, to himself,
&#8216;because,&#8217; said he, &#8216;Dunfermline was in cash, what Lochleven
was in water&mdash;it never ran dry.&#8217;&#8221; A great deal of
booty was obtained by the Tinklers, at the large and long-continued
fairs which were frequently held in this populous
manufacturing town, in the olden times.</p>

<p>This Gipsy priest was uncommonly fond of a bottle of
good ale. Like many other celebrators of marriages, he
derived considerable emoluments from his office. A Gipsy
informed me that Robertson, on these occasions, always received
presents, such as a pair of candlesticks, or basins and
platters, made of pewter, and such like articles. The disobedient
and refractory members of his clan were chastised
by him at all times, on the spot, by the blows of his cudgel,
without regard to age or sex, or manner of striking. When
any serious scuffle arose among his people, in which he was
like to meet with resistance, he would, with vehemence, call
to his particular friends, &#8220;Set my back to the wa&#8217;;&#8221; and,
being thus defended in the rear, he, with his cudgel, made
his assailants in front smart for their rebellion. Although
he could not see, his daughter would give him the word of
command. She would call to him, &#8220;Strike down&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Strike
laigh&#8221; (low)&mdash;&#8220;Strike amawn&#8221; (athwart,)&mdash;&#8220;Strike haunch-ways,&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Strike
shoulder-ways,&#8221; &amp;c. In these, we see
nearly all the cuts or strokes of the Hungarian sword-exercise.
As I have frequently mentioned, all the Gipsies were
regularly trained to a peculiar method of their own in handling
the cudgel, in their battles. I am inclined to think that
part of the Hungarian sword-exercise, at present practised
in our cavalry, is founded upon the Gipsy manner of attack
and defence, including even the direct thrust to the front,
which the Gipsies perform with the cudgel.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all that has been said of the licentious
manners of the Scottish Gipsies, I am convinced that the
slightest infidelity, on the part of their wives, would be punished
with the utmost severity. I am assured that nothing
can put a Gipsy into so complete a rage as to impute incontinence
to his wife. In India, the Gipsy men &#8220;are extremely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
jealous of their wives, who are kept in strict subservance,
and are in danger of corporeal punishment, or absolute dismissal,
if they happen to displease them.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor177" id="FNanchor177"></a><a href="#Footnote177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> The Gipsies are
complete Tartars in matters of this kind.<a name="FNanchor178" id="FNanchor178"></a><a href="#Footnote178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>But in the best-regulated society&mdash;in the most virtuous of
families&mdash;the sundering of the marriage-tie is often unavoidable,
even under the most heinous of circumstances. And it
is not to be expected that the Gipsies should be exempted
from the lot common to humanity, under whatever circumstances
it may be placed. The separation of husband and
wife is, with them, a very serious and melancholy affair&mdash;an
event greatly to be lamented, while the ceremony is attended
with much grief and mourning, blood having to be shed, and
life taken, on the occasion.</p>

<p>It would be a conclusion naturally to be drawn from the
circumstance of the Gipsies having so singular a marriage
ceremony, that they should have its concomitant in as singular
a ceremony of divorce. The first recourse to which a
savage would naturally resort, in giving vent to his indignation,
and obtaining satisfaction for the infidelity of the female,
(assuming that savages are always susceptible of such
a feeling,) would be to despatch her on the spot. But the
principle of expiation, in the person of a dumb creature, for
offences committed against the Deity, has, from the very
creation of the world, been so universal among mankind,
that it would not be wondered at if it should have been applied
for the atonement of offences committed against each
other, and nowhere so much so as in the East&mdash;the land of
figure and allegory. The practice obtains with the Gipsies
in the matter of divorce, for they lay upon the head of that
noble animal, the horse, the sins of their offending sister,
and generally let her go free. But, it may be asked, how
has this sacrifice of the horse never been mentioned in Scotland
before? The same question applies equally well to
their language, and marriage ceremony, yet we know that
both of these exist at the present day. The fact is, the Gipsies
have hitherto been so completely despised, and held in
such thorough contempt, that few ever thought of, or would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
venture to make enquiries of them relative to, their ancient
customs and manners; and that, when any of their ceremonies
were actually observed by the people at large, they
were looked upon as the mere frolics, the unmeaning and
extravagant practices, of a race of beggarly thieves and vagabonds,
unworthy of the slightest attention or credit.<a name="FNanchor179" id="FNanchor179"></a><a href="#Footnote179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> In
whatever country the Gipsies have appeared, they have always
been remarkable for an extraordinary attachment to
the horse. The use which they make of this animal, in sacrifice,
will sufficiently account, in one way at least, for this
peculiar feature in their character. Many of the horses
which have been stolen by them, since their arrival in Europe,
I am convinced, have been used in parting with their
wives, an important religious ceremony&mdash;or at least a custom&mdash;which
they would long remember and practise.<a name="FNanchor180" id="FNanchor180"></a><a href="#Footnote180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>It is the general opinion, founded chiefly upon the affinity
of language, that this singular people migrated from Hindostan.
None of the authors on the Gipsies, however, that
I am aware of, have, in their researches, been able to discover,
among the tribe, any customs of a religious nature,
by which their religious notions and ceremonies, at the time
they entered Europe, could be ascertained. Indeed, the
learned and industrious Grellmann expressly states that the
Gipsies did not bring any particular religion with them,
from their native country, by which they could be distinguished
from other people. The Gipsy sacrifice of the horse,
at parting with their wives, however, appears to be a
remnant of the great Hindoo religious sacrifice of the <i>Aswamedha</i>,
or <i>Assummeed Jugg</i>, observed by all the four
principal castes in India, enumerated in the Gentoo code of
laws, translated from the Persian copy, by Nathaniel Brassey
Halhed, and is proof, besides the similarity of language,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
that the Gipsies are from Hindostan. Before the Gentoo
code of laws came into my hands, I was inclined to believe
that this ceremony of sacrificing horses might be a Tartar
custom, as the ancient Pagan tribes of Tartary also sacrificed
horses, on certain occasions; and my conjectures were countenanced
by the Gipsy and Tartar ceremonies being somewhat
similar in their details. Indeed, in Sweden and
Denmark, and in some parts of Germany, the Gipsies, as I
have already stated, obtained the name of Tartars. &#8220;They
were not allowed the privilege of remaining unmolested in
Denmark, as the code of Danish laws specifies: The Tartar
Gipsies, who wander about everywhere, doing great damage
to the people, by their lies, thefts, and witchcraft, shall be
taken into custody by every magistrate.&#8221; And it also appears,
according to Grellmann, that the Gipsies sometimes
called themselves Tartars. If it was observed, on the continent,
that they sacrificed horses, a custom very common at
one time among the Tartars, their supposed Tartar origin
would appear to have had some foundation. The Tartar
princes seem to have ratified and confirmed their military
leagues by sacrificing horses and drinking of a running
stream; and we find our Scottish Gipsies dissolving their
matrimonial alliances by the solemn sacrifice of the same
animal, while some Gipsies state that horses were also, at
one time, sacrificed at their marriage ceremonies. At these
sacrifices of the Scottish Gipsies, no Deity&mdash;no invisible
agency&mdash;appears, as far as I am informed, to have been invoked
by the sacrificers.</p>

<p>I have alluded to this custom of the Tartars, more particularly,
to show that the Gipsies are not the only people
who have sacrificed horses. The ancient Hindoos, as already
stated, sacrificed horses. The Greeks did the same to Neptune;
the ancient Scandinavians to their god, Assa-Thor,
the representative of the sun; and the Persians, likewise, to
the sun.<a name="FNanchor181" id="FNanchor181"></a><a href="#Footnote181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> But I am inclined to believe that the Gipsy sacrifice
of the horse is the remains of the great <i>Assummeed Jugg</i>
of the Hindoos, observed by tribes of greater antiquity than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the modern nations of India, as appears by the Gentoo code
of laws already <a href="#Page_165">referred to</a>.</p>

<p>The sacrificing of horses is a curious as well as a leading
and important fact in the history of the Gipsies, and, as far
as I know, is new to the world. I shall, in establishing its
existence among the Scottish Gipsies, produce my authorities
with my details.</p>

<p>In the first place, it was, and I believe it still is, a general
tradition, over almost all Scotland, that, when the Tinklers
parted from their wives, the act of separation took place
over the carcass of a dead horse. In respect to McDonald&#8217;s
case, alluded to under the head of Linlithgowshire Gipsies,
my informant, Mr. Alexander Ramsay, late an officer of the
Excise, a very respectable man, who died in 1819, at the age
of 74 years, stated to me that he saw McDonald and his
wife separated over the body of a dead horse, on a moor, at
Shieldhill, near Falkirk, either in the year 1758 or 1760, he
was uncertain which. The horse was laying stretched out
on the heath. The parties took hold of each other by the
hand, and, commencing at the head of the dead animal,
walked&mdash;the husband on one side, and the wife on the other&mdash;till
they came to the tail, when, without speaking a word
to each other, they parted, in opposite directions, as if proceeding
on a journey. Mr. Ramsay said he never could
forget the violent swing which McDonald gave his wife at
parting. The time of the day was a little after day-break.
My informant, at the time, was going, with others, to Shieldhill
for coals, and happened to be passing over a piece of
rising ground, when they came close upon the Gipsies, in a
hollow, quite unexpectedly to both parties.</p>

<p>Another aged man of credibility, of the name of James
Wilson, at North Queensferry, also informed me that it was
within his own knowledge, that a Gipsy, of the name of John
Lundie, divorced four wives over dead horses, in the manner
described. Wilson further mentioned that, when Gipsies
were once regularly separated over a dead horse, they could
never again be united in wedlock; and that, unless they
were divorced in this manner, all the children which the
female might have, subsequently to any other mode of separation,
the husband was obliged to support. In fact, the
transaction was not legal, according to the Gipsy usages,
without the horse. The facts of Lundie, and another Gipsy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
of the name of Drummond, having divorced many wives
over dead horses, have been confirmed to me by several
aged individuals who knew them personally. One intelligent
gentleman, Mr. Richard Baird, informed me that, in his
youth, he actually saw John Lundie separated from one of
his wives over a dead horse, in the parish of Carriden, near
Bo&#8217;ness. My father, who died in 1837, at the age of nearly
83 years, also stated that it was quite current, in Tweed-dale,
that Mary Yorkston, wife of Matthew Baillie, the Gipsy
chief, parted married couples of her tribe over dead horses.</p>

<p>About ten years after receiving the above information,
Malcolm&#8217;s Anecdotes of the Manners and Customs of London
came into my hands; wherein I found the following
quotations, from a work published in 1674, describing the
different classes of impostors at that period in England:
&#8220;Patricos,&#8221; says this old author, &#8220;are strolling priests;
every hedge is their parish, and every wandering rogue
their parishioner. The service, he saith, is the marrying of
couples, without the Gospels or Book of Common Prayer;
the solemnity whereof is this: The parties to be married
find out a dead horse, or other beast; standing, one on the
one side, and the other on the other, the Patrico bids them
live together till death part them; so, shaking hands, the
wedding is ended.&#8221; Now the parties here described seem
to have been no other than Gipsies. But it also appears
that the ceremony alluded to is that of dissolving a marriage,
and not that of celebrating it. It is proper, however,
to mention, as I have already done, that horses, at one time,
were sacrificed at their marriages, as well as at their divorces.</p>

<p>Feeling now quite satisfied that Gipsies were, at one
time, actually separated over the bodies of dead horses, and
horses only, (for I could find no other animal named but
horses,) I proceeded to have the fact confirmed by the direct
testimony of the people themselves. And whether these
horses were sacrificed expressly for such purposes, or whether
the rites were performed over horses accidentally found
dead, I could not discover till the year 1828. It occurred
to me that the using of dead horses, in separating man and
wife, was a remnant of some ancient ceremony, which induced
me to persevere in my enquiries, for the purpose of ascertaining,
if not the origin, at least the particulars, of so extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
a custom. In the year mentioned, and in the
year following, I examined a Gipsy on the subject; a man
of about sixty years of age, who, a few years before, had
given me a specimen of his language. He said that he himself
had witnessed the sacrifices and ceremonies attending
the separation of husband and wife. From this man I received
the following curious particulars relative to the sacrifice
of horses and ceremony of divorce; which I think may
be depended on, as I was very careful in observing that his
statements, taken down at four different times, agreed with
each other.</p>

<p>When the parties can no longer live together as husband
and wife, and a separation for ever is finally determined on,
a horse, without blemish, and in no manner of way lame, is
led forth to the spot for performing the ceremony of divorce.
The hour at which the rites must be performed is, if possible,
twelve o&#8217;clock at noon, &#8220;when the sun is at his height.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor182" id="FNanchor182"></a><a href="#Footnote182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>
The Gipsies present cast lots for the individual who is to
sacrifice the animal, and whom they call the priest, for the
time. The priest, with a long pole or staff in his hand,<a name="FNanchor183" id="FNanchor183"></a><a href="#Footnote183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>
walks round and round the animal several times; repeating
the names of all the persons in whose possession it has been,
and extolling and expatiating on the rare qualities of so useful
an animal. It is now let loose, and driven from their
presence, to do whatever it pleases. The horse, perfect and
free, is put in the room of the woman who is to be divorced;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
and by its different movements is the degree of her guilt
ascertained. Some of the Gipsies now set off in pursuit of
it, and endeavour to catch it. If it is wild and intractable,
kicks, leaps dykes and ditches, scampers about, and will not
allow itself to be easily taken hold of, the crimes and guilt
of the woman are looked upon as numerous and heinous. If
the horse is tame and docile, when it is pursued, and suffers
itself to be taken without much trouble, and without exhibiting
many capers, the guilt of the woman is not considered
so deep and aggravated; and it is then sacrificed in her
stead. But if it is extremely wild and vicious, and cannot
be taken without infinite trouble, her crimes are considered
exceedingly wicked and atrocious; and my informant said
instances occurred in which both horse and woman were
sacrificed at the same time; the death of the horse, alone,
being then considered insufficient to atone for her excessive
guilt. The individuals who catch the horse bring it before
the priest. They repeat to him all the faults and tricks it
had committed; laying the whole of the crimes of which
the woman is supposed to have been guilty to its charge;
and upbraiding and scolding the dumb creature, in an angry
manner, for its conduct. They bring, as it were, an accusation
against it, and plead for its condemnation. When this
part of the trial is finished, the priest takes a large knife
and thrusts it into the heart of the horse; and its blood is
allowed to flow upon the ground till life is extinct. The
dead animal is now stretched out upon the ground. The
husband then takes his stand on one side of it, and the wife
on the other; and, holding each other by the hand, repeat
certain appropriate sentences in the Gipsy language. They
then quit hold of each other, and walk three times round the
body of the horse, contrariwise, passing and crossing each
other, at certain points, as they proceed in opposite directions.
At certain parts of the animal, (the <i>corners</i> of the horse, was
the Gipsy&#8217;s expression,) such as the hind and fore feet, the
shoulders and haunches, the head and tail, the parties halt,
and face each other; and again repeat sentences, in their
own speech, at each time they halt. The two last stops they
make, in their circuit round the sacrifice, are at the head and
tail. At the head, they again face each other, and speak;
and lastly, at the tail, they again confront each other, utter
some more Gipsy expressions, shake hands, and finally part,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the one going north, the other south, never again to be
united in this life.<a name="FNanchor184" id="FNanchor184"></a><a href="#Footnote184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Immediately after the separation takes
place, the woman receives a token, which is made of cast-iron,
about an inch and a half square, with a mark upon it
resembling the Roman character, T. After the marriage has
been dissolved, and the woman dismissed from the sacrifice,
the heart of the horse is taken out and roasted with fire,
then sprinkled with vinegar, or brandy, and eaten by the
husband and his friends then present; the female not being
allowed to join in this part of the ceremony. The body of
the horse, skin and everything about it, except the heart, is
buried on the spot; and years after the ceremony has taken
place, the husband and his friends visit the grave of the
animal, to see whether it has been disturbed. At these
visits, they walk round about the grave, with much grief and
mourning.</p>

<p>The husband may take another wife whenever he pleases,
but the female is never permitted to marry again.<a name="FNanchor185" id="FNanchor185"></a><a href="#Footnote185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> The
token, or rather bill of divorce, which she receives, must
never be from about her person. If she loses it, or attempts
to pass herself off as a woman never before married, she
becomes liable to the punishment of death. In the event of
her breaking this law, a council of the chiefs is held upon
her conduct, and her fate is decided by a majority of the
members; and, if she is to suffer death, her sentence must
be confirmed by the king, or principal leader. The culprit
is then tied to a stake, with an iron chain, and there cudgelled
to death. The executioners do not extinguish life at one
beating, but leave the unhappy woman for a little while, and
return to her, and at last complete their work by despatching
her on the spot.</p>

<p>I have been informed of an instance of a Gipsy falling out
with his wife, and, in the heat of his passion, shooting his
own horse dead on the spot with his pistol, and forthwith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
performing the ceremony of divorce over the animal, without
allowing himself a moment&#8217;s time for reflection on the
subject. Some of the country-people observed the transaction,
and were horrified at so extraordinary a proceeding.
It was considered by them as merely a mad frolic of an enraged
Tinkler. It took place many years ago, in a wild, sequestered
spot between Galloway and Ayrshire.</p>

<p>This sacrifice of the horse is also observed by the Gipsies
of the Russian Empire. In the year 1830, a Russian gentleman
of observation and intelligence, proprietor of estates on
the banks of the Don, stated to me that the Gipsies in the
neighbourhood of Moscow, and on the Don, several hundred
versts from the sea of Asoph, sacrificed horses, and ate part
of their flesh, in the performance of some very ancient ceremony
of idolatry. They sacrifice them under night, in the
woods, as the practice is prohibited by the Russian Government.
The police are often detecting the Gipsies in these
sacrifices, and the ceremony is kept as secret as possible.
My informant could not go into the particulars of the Gipsy
sacrifice in Russia; but there is little doubt that it is the
same which the tribe performed in Scotland. In Russia, the
Gipsies, like those in this country, have a language peculiar
to themselves, which they retain as a secret among their own
fraternity.</p>

<p>As regards the sacrificing of horses by the Gipsies of
Scotland, at the present day, all that I can say is that I do
not know of its taking place; nor has it been denied to me.
The only conclusion to which I can come, in regard to the
question, is that it is in the highest degree probable that,
like their language and ceremony of marriage, it is still
practised when it can be done. In carrying out this ceremony,
there is an obstacle to be overcome which does not
lay in the way of that of marriage, and it is this: Where are
many of the Tinklers to find a horse, over which they can
obtain a divorce? The difficulty with them is as great as
it is with the people of England, who must, at a frightful
expense, go to no less than the House of Lords to obtain an
act to separate legally from their unfaithful partners.<a name="FNanchor186" id="FNanchor186"></a><a href="#Footnote186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> The
Gipsies, besides being generally unable or unwilling to bear
the expense of what will procure them a release in their own
way, find it a difficult matter, in these days, to steal, carry off,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
and dispose of such a bulky article as a horse, in the sacrifice
of which they will find a new wife. I am not aware
how they get quit of this solemn and serious difficulty, beyond
this, that a Gipsy, a native of Yetholm, informed me
that some of his brethren in that colony knock down their
<i>asses</i>, for the purpose of parting with their wives, at the present
day.<a name="FNanchor187" id="FNanchor187"></a><a href="#Footnote187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>As the code of the ancient laws of Hindostan is not in
the hands of every one, I shall here transcribe from the
work the account of the Gentoo Institution of the <i>Aswamedha</i>
or the <i>Assummeed Jugg</i>,<a name="FNanchor188" id="FNanchor188"></a><a href="#Footnote188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> that the reader may compare
it with the Gipsy sacrifice of horses; for which, owing
to its length, I must crave his indulgence. It is under the
chapter of evidence, and is as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;An <i>Assummeed Jugg</i> is when a person, having commenced
a Jugg, writes various articles upon a scroll of
paper on a horse&#8217;s neck, and dismisses the horse, sending,
along with the horse, a stout and valiant person, equipped
with the best necessaries and accoutrements, to accompany
the horse day and night, whithersoever he shall choose to
go; and if any creature, either man, genius or dragon,
should seize the horse, that man opposes such attempt, and,
having gained the victory, upon a battle, again gives the
horse his freedom. If any one in this world, or in heaven,
or beneath the earth, would seize this horse, and the horse
of himself comes to the house of the celebrator of the <i>Jugg</i>,
upon killing that horse, he must throw the flesh of him upon
the fire of the <i>Juk</i>, and utter the prayers of his Deity; such a
<i>Jugg</i> is called a <i>Jugg Assummeed</i>, and the merit of it, as
a religious work, is infinite.&#8221; <i>Page 127.</i></p>

<p>In another part of the same chapter of the Hindoo code
of laws, are the following particulars relative to horses,
which show the great respect in which these animals were
held among the ancient natives of Hindostan. &#8220;In an affair
concerning a horse: if any person gives false evidence, his
guilt is as great as the guilt of murdering one hundred persons.&#8221;
<i>Page 128.</i> In the Asiatic Researches, the sacrifice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
of the horse is frequently noticed; and in Sir William
Jones&#8217; Institutes of Menu, chapter viii., page 202, it is said:
&#8220;A false witness, in the case of a horse, kills, or incurs the
guilt of killing, one hundred kinsmen.&#8221; &#8220;The <i>Aswamedha</i>,
or sacrifice of the horse: Considerable difficulties usually
attend that ceremony; for the consecrated horse was to be
set at liberty for a certain time, and followed at a distance
by the owner, or his champion, who was usually one of his
near kinsmen; and if any person should attempt to stop it
in its rambles, a battle must inevitably ensue; besides, as
the performer of an hundred <i>Aswamedhas</i> became equal to
the god of the firmaments.&#8221; (<i>Asiatic Researches, vol.</i> iii.,
<i>page 216</i>.) &#8220;The inauguration of <i>Indra</i>, (the Indian God of
the firmaments,) it appears, was performed by sacrificing an
hundred horses. It is imagined that this celebration becomes
a cause of obtaining great power and universal monarchy;
and many of the kings in ancient India performed
this sacrifice at their inauguration, similar to that of Indra&#8217;s.&#8221;
&#8220;These monarchs were consecrated by these great
sacrifices, with a view to become universal conquerors.&#8221;
(<i>Asiatic Researches.</i>) It appears, by the Hindoo mythology,
that <i>Indra</i> was at one time a mere mortal, but by sacrificing
an hundred horses, he became sovereign of the firmament;
and that should any Indian monarch succeed in immolating an
hundred horses, he would displace <i>Indra</i>.</p>

<p>The above are literal and simple facts, which took place
in performing the sacrifice; but the following is the explanation
of the mystic signification contained in the ceremony.</p>

<p>&#8220;The <i>Assummeed Jugg</i> does not merely consist in the
performance of that ceremony which is open to the inspection
of the world, namely, in bringing a horse, and sacrificing
him; but <i>Assummeed</i> is to be taken in a mystic signification,
as implying that the sacrificer must look upon himself
to be typified in that horse, such as he shall be described;
because the religious duty of the <i>Assummeed Jugg</i> comprehends
all those other religious duties, to the performance of
which all the wise and holy direct all their actions; and by
which all the sincere professors of every different faith aim
at perfection. The mystic signification thereof is as follows:
The head of that unblemished horse is the symbol
of the morning; his eyes are the sun; his breath the wind;
his wide-opening mouth is the <i>Bishw&#257;ner</i>, or that innate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
warmth which invigorates all the world; his body typifies
one entire year; his back, paradise; his belly, the plains;
his hoof, this earth; his sides, the four quarters of the heavens;
the bones thereof, the intermediate spaces between
the four quarters; the rest of his limbs represent all distinct
matter; the places where those limbs meet, or his joints, imply
the months, and halves of the months, which are called <i>P&#277;ch&#277;</i>
(or fortnights); his feet signify night and day; and night and
day are of four kinds; first, the night and day of Brihma;
second, the night and day of angels; third, the night and day
of the world of the spirits of deceased ancestors; fourth, the
night and day of mortals. These four kinds are typified in
his four feet. The rest of his bones are the constellations
of the fixed stars, which are the twenty-eight stages of the
moon&#8217;s course, called the lunar year; his flesh is the clouds;
his food the sand; his tendons the rivers; his spleen and
liver the mountains; the hair of his body the vegetables,
and his long hair the trees. The fore part of his body typifies
the first half of the day, and the hinder part the latter
half; his yawning is the flash of the lightning, and his
turning himself is the thunder of the cloud; his urine represents
the rain; and his mental reflection is his only
speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;The golden vessels, which are prepared before the horse
is let loose, are the light of the day; and the place where
these vessels are kept is a type of the ocean of the East;
the silver vessels, which are prepared after the horse is let
loose, are the light of the night; and the place where those
vessels are kept is a type of the ocean of the West. These
two sorts of vessels are always before and after the horse.
The Arabian horse, which, on account of his swiftness, is
called <i>Hy</i>, is the performer of the journeys of angels; the
<i>T&#257;jee</i>, which is of the race of Persian horses, is the performer
of the journeys of the <i>Kundherps</i> (or the good spirits);
the <i>W&#257;zb&#257;</i>, which is of the race of the deformed <i>T&#257;jee</i>
horses, is the performer of the journeys of <i>Jins</i> (or demons);
and the <i>Ashoo</i>, which is of the race of Turkish horses, is
the performer of the journeys of mankind. This one horse
which performs these several services, on account of his
four different sorts of riders, obtains the four different appellations.
The place where this horse remains is the great
ocean, which signifies the great spirit of <i>Perm-atm&#257;</i>, or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
universal soul, which proceeds also from that <i>Perm-atm&#257;</i>,
and is comprehended in the same <i>Perm-atm&#257;</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;The intent of this sacrifice is, that a man should consider
himself to be in the place of that horse, and look upon
all these articles as typified in himself; and conceiving the
<i>Atm&#257;</i> (or divine soul) to be an ocean, should let all thought
of self be absorbed in that <i>Atm&#257;</i>.&#8221; <i>Page 19.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Halhed, the translator, justly observes: &#8220;This is the
very acme and enthusiasm of allegory, and wonderfully displays
the picturesque powers of fancy in an Asiatic genius;
yet, unnatural as the account there stands, it is seriously
credited by the Hindoos of all denominations.&#8221; On the
other hand, he thinks there is a great resemblance between
this very ancient Hindoo ceremony and the sacrifice of the
scape-goat, in the Bible, described in the 21st and 22d
verses of the 16th chapter of Leviticus, viz.: &#8220;And Aaron
shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and
confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel,
and all their transgressions, in all their sins, putting them
upon the head of the goat; and shall send him away, by the
hand of a fit man, into the wilderness: and the goat shall
bear upon him all their iniquities into a land not inhabited;
and he shall let go the goat into the wilderness.&#8221; <i>Page 17.</i>
In the same manner, all the iniquities of the sacrificer, in
the Gentoo ceremony, are laid upon the horse, which is let
loose, and attended by a stout and valiant person. The
same is done in the Gipsy sacrifice, as typifying the woman
to be divorced.</p>

<p>The resemblance between the Gipsy and the Hindoo sacrifice
is close and striking in their general bearings. The
Hindoo sacrificer is typified in the horse, and his sins are
ascertained and described by the motions or movements of
the animal; for if the horse is very docile and tame, and of
its own accord comes to the Hindoo celebrator of the sacrifice,
his merits are then infinite, and extremely acceptable to
the Deity worshipped. In the Gipsy sacrifice, if the horse
is in like manner quiet, and easily caught, the woman, whom
it represents, is then comparatively innocent. In India, part
of the <i>flesh</i> of the horse was eaten: among the Gipsies, the
<i>heart</i> is eaten. The Hindoos sacrificed their <i>enemies</i>, by
substituting for them a <i>buffalo</i>, &amp;c.: the Gipsies sacrifice
their <i>unfaithful wives</i>, by the substitute of a <i>horse</i>. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Hindoo sacrifice, particular parts of the horse allegorically
represent certain parts of the earth: at certain parts of the
horse, (the <i>corners</i>, as the Gipsies call them,) the Gipsies, in
their circuit round the animal, halt, and utter particular
sentences in their own language, as if these parts were of
more importance, and had more influence, than the other
parts. And it is probable that, in these sentences, some invisible
agency was addressed and invoked by the Gipsies.</p>

<p>As the <i>Aswamedha</i>, or sacrifice of the horse, was the most
important of all the religious ceremonies of every caste of
Hindoos, in ancient India, so it would be the last to be forgotten
by the wandering Gipsies. And as both sacrificed at
twelve o&#8217;clock, noon, I am inclined to believe that both offered
their sacrifice to the sun, the animating soul of universal
nature. As already stated, the Gipsies, while travelling,
assume new names every morning before setting out; but
when noon-tide arrives, they resume their permanent English
ones. This custom is practised daily, and has undoubtedly
also some reference to the sun. By the account of the Gipsy
already mentioned, the horse must, if possible, be killed at
noon. According to Southey, in his curse of Kehamah, the
sacrifice of the horse in India was performed at the same
time. Colonel Tod, in his history of India, says: &#8220;The
sacrifice of the horse is the most imposing, and the earliest,
heathenish rite on record, and was dedicated to the sun, anciently,
in India.&#8221; According to the same author, the horse
in India must be milk-white, with particular marks upon it.
The Gipsy&#8217;s horse to be sacrificed must be sound, and without
blemish; but no particular colour is mentioned. According
to Halhed, the horse sacrificed in India was also
without blemish.</p>

<p>I have, perhaps, been too minute and tedious in describing
these rites and ceremonies of the Gentoos; but the singular
fact that our Scottish Tinklers yet&mdash;at least till very lately&mdash;retained
the important fragments of the ancient mythology
of the Pagan tribes of Hindostan, is offered as an apology to
the curious reader for the trouble of perusing the details. I
shall only add, that there appears to be nearly as great a
resemblance between the sacrifices of the Gipsies and the
ancient Hindoos, as there is affinity between modern Hindostanee
and the language of the Gipsies in Scotland, at the
present day, as will be seen in the <a href="#Page_281">following chapter</a>.</p>

<p>The above table will give a general idea of the natural encrease of the
Gipsies. The reader can make what allowances he pleases, for ages at time
of marriage, intervals between births, twins, deaths, or numbers of children
born. By this table, the Gipsy, by marrying at twenty years of age,
would, when 54 years old, have a &#8220;following&#8221; of no less than 78 souls.
&#8220;There is one of the divine laws,&#8221; said I to a Gipsy, &#8220;which the Gipsies
obey more than any other people.&#8221; &#8220;What is that?&#8221; replied he, with
great gravity. &#8220;The command to &#8216;Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish
(but not subdue) the earth.&#8217;&#8221; Even five generations can be obtained from
the male, and six from the female Gipsy, in a century, counting from first-born
to first-born. The reader will notice how large are the Gipsy families
incidentally mentioned by our author.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote171" id="Footnote171"></a><a href="#FNanchor171"><span class="label">[171]</span></a> &#8220;I was soon tired,&#8221; says Park, &#8220;and had retired into my tent. When
I was sitting, almost asleep, an old woman entered with a wooden bowl in
her hand, and signified that she had brought me a present from the bride.
Before I could recover from the surprise which this message created, the
woman discharged the contents of the bowl full in my face. Finding that
it was the same sort of holy water with which, among the Hottentots, a
priest is said to sprinkle a new-married couple, I began to suspect that the
lady was actuated by mischief or malice; but she gave me seriously to understand
that it was a nuptial benediction from the bride&#8217;s own person;
and which, on such occasions, is always received by the young unmarried
Moors, as a mark of distinguished favour. This being the case, I wiped my
face, and sent my acknowledgment to the lady.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Park&#8217;s Travels, pages 205

<p><a name="Footnote173" id="Footnote173"></a><a href="#FNanchor173"><span class="label">[173]</span></a> On their return from church, the bride is seated at one extremity of a
room, with the unmarried girls by her; the bridegroom on the right, and
the father and mother, or those who perform their office, on the left. The
male part of the company stand in the corners, singing, and playing on the
guitar. About one o&#8217;clock, the oldest matron, accompanied by others advanced
in years, conducts the bride into the bed-room, which, according to
the custom of Spain, is usually a small chamber, without a window, opening
into the general apartment. <i>Tune vetula, manu sud spons&aelig; naturalibus admota
membranam, vulv&aelig; ori oppositam unguibus scindit et cruorem &agrave; plag&acirc;
fusum linteolo excipit.</i> The Gitanos without make a loud noise with their
whistles, and the girls, striking the door, sing the following couplets, or
some other like them:</p>

<div class="poem" style="font-size: 90%;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;Abra vi&ntilde;d la puerta Snr. Joaquin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Que le voy &agrave; vi&ntilde;d &agrave; poner un pa&ntilde;uelito<br /></span>
<span class="i0">En las manos que tienen que llorar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toditas las callis.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The bride then returns from the chamber, accompanied by the matrons,
and the new-married couple are placed upon a table, where the bride
dances, <i>et coram astantibus linteolum, internerati pudoris indicium explicat</i>;
whilst the company, throwing down their presents of sweetmeats, &amp;c.,
dance and cry, &#8220;Viva la honra.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Bright, on the Spanish Gipsy marriage.</i></p>

<p>Before the marriage festival begins, four matrons&mdash;relations of the contracting
parties&mdash;are appointed to scrutinize the bride; in which a handkerchief,
of the finest French cambric, takes a leading part. Should she
prove frail, she will likely be made away with, in a way that will leave no
trace behind. In carrying out some marriage festivals, a procession will
take place, led by some vile-looking fellow, bearing, on the end of a long
pole, the <i>dicl&eacute;</i> and unspotted handkerchief; followed by the betrothed and
their nearest friends, and a rabble of Gipsies, shouting and firing, and barking
of dogs. On arriving at the church, the pole, with its triumphant
colours, is stuck into the ground, with a loud huzza; while the train defile,
on either side, into the church. On returning home, the same takes place.
Then follows the most ludicrous and wasteful kind of revelling, which often
leaves the bridegroom a beggar for life.&mdash;<i>Borrow, on the Spanish Gipsy marriage.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote174" id="Footnote174"></a><a href="#FNanchor174"><span class="label">[174]</span></a> The part of the marriage ceremony of the Gipsies which relates to the
chastity of the bride has a great resemblance to a part of the nuptial rites
of the Russians, and the Christians of St. John, in Mesopotamia and Chaldea.
Dr. Hurd says: &#8220;When a new-married couple in Russia retire to the nuptial
bed, an old domestic servant stands sentinel at the chamber-door.
Some travellers tell us that this old servant, as soon as it is proper, attends
nearer the bedside, to be informed of what happens. Upon the husband&#8217;s
declaration of his success and satisfaction, the kettle-drums and trumpets
proclaim the joyful news.&#8221; Among the Christians of St. John, as soon as
the marriage is consummated, &#8220;both parties wait upon the bishop, and the
husband deposes before him that he found his wife a virgin; and then the
bishop marries them, puts several rings on their fingers, and baptizes them
again .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A marriage with one who is discovered to have lost her
honour beforehand but very seldom, if ever, holds good.&#8221;</p>

<p>When speaking of the marriages of the Mandingoes, at Kamalia, about
500 miles in the interior of Africa, Park says: &#8220;The new-married couple
are always disturbed toward morning by the women, who assemble to inspect
the nuptial sheet, (according to the manners of the ancient Hebrews, as
recorded in Scripture,) and dance around it. This ceremony is thought
indispensably necessary, nor is the marriage considered valid without it.&#8221;
<i>Park&#8217;s Travels, page 399.</i></p>

<p>By the laws of Menu, the Hindoo could reject his bride, if he found her
not a virgin.&mdash;<i>Sir William Jones.</i></p>

<p>[The reader will observe that the marriage ceremony of the Gipsies,
though barbarous, is very figurative and emphatic, and certainly moral
enough. To show that the Gipsies, as a people, have not been addicted
to the most barbarous customs, in regard to marriage, I note the following
very singular form of the Scottish Highlanders, which, according to Skene,
continued in use <i>until a very late period</i>. &#8220;This custom was termed <i>hand-fasting</i>,
and consisted in a species of contract between two chiefs, by which
it was agreed that the heir of one should live with the daughter of the
other, as her husband, for twelve months and a day. If, in that time, the
lady became a mother, or proved to be with child, the marriage became
good in law, even although no priest had performed the marriage in due
form; but should there not have occurred any appearance of issue, the contract
was considered at an end, and each party was at liberty to marry, or
<i>hand-fast, with any other</i>.&#8221; Which fact shows that Highland chiefs, at one
time, would have annulled any, or all, of the laws of God, whenever it
would have served their purposes.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p><a name="Footnote175" id="Footnote175"></a><a href="#FNanchor175"><span class="label">[175]</span></a> On reading the above ceremony to an intelligent native of Fife, he said
he had himself heard a Gipsy, of the name of Thomas Ogilvie, say that
the Tinklers were married in the way mentioned. On one occasion, when
a couple of respectable individuals were married, in the usual Scottish
Presbyterian manner, at Elie, in Fife, Ogilvie, Gipsy-like, laughed at such
a wedding ceremony, as being, in his estimation, no way binding on the
parties. He at the same time observed that, if they would come to him,
he would marry them in the Tinkler manner, which would make it a difficult
matter to separate them again.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote176" id="Footnote176"></a><a href="#FNanchor176"><span class="label">[176]</span></a> Two ram&#8217;s horns and two spoons, crossed, are sculptured on the tombstone
of William Marshall, a Gipsy chief, who, according to a writer in
Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine, died at the age of 120 years, and whose remains are
deposited in the church-yard of Kirkcudbright.</p>

<p>A horn is the hieroglyphic of authority, power, and dignity, and is a
metaphor often made use of in the Scriptures. The Jews held ram&#8217;s horns
in great veneration, on account, it is thought, of that animal having been
caught in a bush by the horns, and used as a substitute, when Isaac was
about to be sacrificed by his father; or, perhaps, on account of this animal
being first used in sacrifice. So much were ram&#8217;s horns esteemed by the
Israelites, that their Priests and Levites used them as trumpets, particularly
at the taking of Jericho. The modern Jews, when they confess their sins,
in our month of September, announce the ceremony by blowing a ram&#8217;s
horn, the sound of which, they say, drives away the Devil. In ancient
Egypt, and other parts of Africa, Jupiter Ammon was worshipped under the
figure of a ram, and to this deity one of these animals was sacrificed annually.
A ram seems to have been an emblem of power in the East, from the
remotest ages. It would, therefore, appear that the practice of the Gipsy
priest &#8220;wearing a ram&#8217;s horn, suspended from a string, around his neck,&#8221;
must be derived from the highest antiquity.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote178" id="Footnote178"></a><a href="#FNanchor178"><span class="label">[178]</span></a> Mr. Borrow bears very positive testimony to the <i>personal</i> virtue of
Gipsy females. I have heard natives of Hungary speak lightly of them in
that respect; but I conclude that they alluded to exceptions to the general
rule among the race.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote179" id="Footnote179"></a><a href="#FNanchor179"><span class="label">[179]</span></a> What our author says, relative to the sacrifice of the horse, by the Gipsies,
not being known to the people of Scotland at large, is equally applicable
to the entire subject of the tribe. And we see here how admirably the
passions&mdash;in this case, the prejudice and incredulity&mdash;of mankind are calculated
to blind them to facts, perhaps to facts the most obvious and incontestible.
What is stated of the Gipsies in this work, generally, should be
no matter of wonder; the real wonder, if wonder there should be, is that it
should not have been known to the world before.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote180" id="Footnote180"></a><a href="#FNanchor180"><span class="label">[180]</span></a> Grellmann says, of the Hungarian Gipsies, &#8220;The greatest luxury to
them is when they can procure a roast of cattle that have died of any distemper,
whether it be sheep, pig, cow, or other beast, <i>a horse only excepted</i>.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote181" id="Footnote181"></a><a href="#FNanchor181"><span class="label">[181]</span></a> It appears that the Jews, when they lapsed into the grossest idolatry,
dedicated horses to the sun. &#8220;And he (Josiah) took away the horses that
the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of
the Lord, by the chamber of Nathan-melech, the chamberlain, which was in
the suburbs, and burnt the chariots of the sun with fire.&#8221; II Kings, xxiii. 11.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote182" id="Footnote182"></a><a href="#FNanchor182"><span class="label">[182]</span></a> This Gipsy mentioned one particular instance of having seen a couple
separated in this way, on a wild moor, near Huntly, about the year 1805.
He particularly stated that a horse found dead would not do for a separation,
but that one must be killed for the express purpose; and that &#8220;the
sun must be at his height&#8221; before the horse could be properly sacrificed.
From the fact of Ramsay stumbling upon the Gipsies &#8220;a little after day-break,&#8221;
it would seem that circumstances had compelled them to change
the time, or adjourn the completion, of the sacrifice; or that the extreme
wildness of the victim had prevented its being caught, and so led to the
&#8220;violent swing which McDonald gave his wife at parting.&#8221; And it might
be that Ramsay had come upon them when McDonald and his wife were
performing the last part of the ceremony, or had caused them to finish it
abruptly; as the old Gipsy stated that not only are none but Gipsies
allowed to be present on such occasions, but that the greatest secrecy is
observed, to prevent discovery by those who are not of the tribe.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote183" id="Footnote183"></a><a href="#FNanchor183"><span class="label">[183]</span></a> It appears all the Gipsies, male as well as female, who perform ceremonies
for their tribe, carry long staffs. In the Institutes of Menu, page
28, it is written: &#8220;The staff of a priest must be of such length as to reach
his hair; that of a soldier to reach his forehead; and that of a merchant
to reach the nose.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote184" id="Footnote184"></a><a href="#FNanchor184"><span class="label">[184]</span></a> That I might distinctly understand the Gipsy, when he described the
manner of crossing and wheeling round the corners of the horse, a common
sitting-chair was placed on its side between us, which represented the
animal lying on the ground.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote185" id="Footnote185"></a><a href="#FNanchor185"><span class="label">[185]</span></a> Bright, on the Spanish Gipsies, says: &#8220;Widows never marry again,
are distinguished by mourning-veils, and black shoes made like those
of a man; no slight mortification, in a country where the females are so remarkable
for the beauty of their feet.&#8221; It is most likely that <i>divorced female
Gipsies</i> are confounded here with <i>widows</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote186" id="Footnote186"></a><a href="#FNanchor186"><span class="label">[186]</span></a> This difficulty has been removed by recent legislation.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>LANGUAGE.</h3>

<p>The Scottish Gipsies appear to be extremely tenacious of
retaining their language, as their principal secret, among
themselves, and seem, from what I have read on the subject,
to be much less communicative, on this and other matters
relative to their history, than those of England and other
countries. On speaking to them of their speech, they exhibit
an extraordinary degree of fear, caution, reluctance,
distrust, and suspicion; and, rather than give any information
on the subject, will submit to any self-denial. It has
been so well retained among themselves, that I believe it is
scarcely credited, even by individuals of the greatest intelligence,
that it exists at all, at the present day, but as slang,
used by common thieves, house-breakers and beggars, and
by those denominated flash and family men.<a name="FNanchor189" id="FNanchor189"></a><a href="#Footnote189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>Among the causes contributing to this state of things
among the Scottish Gipsies, and what are called Tinklers
or Tinkers, for they are the same people, may be mentioned
the following: The traditional accounts of the numerous
imprisonments, banishments, and executions, which
many of the race underwent, for merely being &#8220;by habit
and repute Gipsies,&#8221; under the severe laws passed against
them, are still fresh in the memories of the present generation.
They still entertain the idea that they are a persecuted
race, and liable, if known to be Gipsies, to all the
penalties of the statutes framed for the extirpation of the
whole people. But, apart from this view of the question,
it may be asked, how is it that the Gipsies in Scotland are
more reserved, (they are generally altogether silent,) in respect
to themselves, than their brethren in other countries
seem to be? It may be answered, that our Scottish tribes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
are, in general, much more civilized, their bands more broken
up, and the individuals more mixed with, and scattered
through, the general population of the country, than the
Gipsies of other nations; and it therefore appears to me
that the more their blood gets mixed with that of the ordinary
natives, and the more they approach to civilization, the
more determinedly will they conceal every particular relative
to their tribe, to prevent their neighbours ascertaining
their origin and nationality. The slightest taunting allusion
to the forefathers of half-civilized Scottish Tinklers
kindles up in their breasts a storm of wrath and fury: for
they are extremely sensitive to the feeling which is entertained
toward their tribe by the other inhabitants of the
country.<a name="FNanchor190" id="FNanchor190"></a><a href="#Footnote190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> &#8220;I have,&#8221; said one of them to me, &#8220;wrought all
my life in a shop with fellow-tradesmen, and not one of
them ever discovered that I knew a single Gipsy word.&#8221; A
Gipsy woman also informed me that herself and sister had
nearly lost their lives, on account of their language. The
following are the particulars: The two sisters chanced to
be in a public-house near Alloa, when a number of colliers,
belonging to the coal-works at Sauchie, were present. The
one sister, in a low tone of voice, and in the Gipsy language,
desired the other, among other things, to make ready some
broth for their repast. The colliers took hold of the two
Gipsy words, <i>shaucha</i> and <i>blawkie</i>, which signify broth and
pot; thinking the Tinkler women were calling them <i>Sauchie
Blackies</i>, in derision and contempt of their dark, subterraneous
calling. The consequence was, that the savage colliers
attacked the innocent Tinklers, calling out that they would
&#8220;grind them to powder,&#8221; for calling them <i>Sauchie Blackies</i>.
But the determined Gipsies would rather perish than explain
the meaning of the words in English, to appease the enraged
colliers; &#8220;for,&#8221; said they, &#8220;it would have exposed
our tribe, and made ourselves odious to the world.&#8221; The
two defenceless females might have been murdered by their
brutal assailants, had not the master of the house fortunately
come to their assistance. The poor Gipsies felt the effects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
of the beating they had received, for many months thereafter;
and my informant had not recovered from her bruises at the
time she mentioned the circumstances to me.<a name="FNanchor191" id="FNanchor191"></a><a href="#Footnote191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>They are also anxious to retain their language, as a secret
among themselves, for the use which it is to them in conducting
business in markets or other places of public resort.
But they are very chary of the manner in which they employ
it on such occasions. Besides this, they display all the
pride and vanity in possessing the language which is common
with linguists generally. The determined and uniform
principle laid down by them, to avoid all communications
with &#8220;strangers&#8221; on the subject, and their resolution
to keep it a secret within their own tribe, will be strikingly
illustrated by the following facts.</p>

<p>For seven years, a woman, of the name of Baillie, about
fifty years of age, and the mother of a family, called regularly
at my house, twice a year, while on her peregrinations
through the country, selling spoons and other articles made
from horn. Every time I saw her, I endeavoured to prevail
upon her to give me some of her secret speech, as I was certain
she was acquainted with the Gipsy tongue. But, not
to alarm her by calling it by that name, I always said to
her, in a jocular manner, that it was the <i>mason</i> word I wished
her to teach me. She, however, as regularly and firmly
declared that she knew of no such language among the
Tinklers. I always treated her kindly, and desired her to
continue her visits. I gave her, each time she called, a
glass of spirits, a piece of flesh, and such articles; and
generally purchased some trifle from her, for which I intentionally
paid her more than its value. She so far yielded
to my importunities, that, for the last three years she called,
she went the length of saying that she would tell me &#8220;something&#8221;
the next time she came back. But when she returned,
she guardedly evaded all my questions, by constantly repeating
nearly the same answer, such as, &#8220;I will speak to you
the next time I come back, sir.&#8221; After having been put off
for <i>seven</i> years in this manner, I was determined to put her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
to the usual test, should she never enter my door again, and,
as she was walking out of the gate of my garden, I called to
her, in the Gipsy language, &#8220;<i>Jaw vree, managie!</i>&#8220;&mdash;(go away,
woman.) She immediately turned round, and, laughing, replied,
&#8220;I will <i>jaw</i> with you when I come back, <i>gaugie</i>&#8220;&mdash;(I
will go or speak with you, when I come back, man.) She
returned, as usual, in December following. I again requested
her to give me some of her words, assuring her that
she would be in no danger from me on that account. I further
told her it was of no use to conceal her speech from me,
having, the last time she was in my house, shown her that I
was acquainted with it. After considerable hesitation and
reluctance, she consented; but then, she said, she would not
allow any one in the house to hear her speak to me but my
wife. I took her at once into my parlour, and, on being
desired, she, without the least hesitation or embarrassment,
took the seat next the fire. Observing the door of the room
a little open, she desired it to be shut, in case of her being
overheard, again mentioning that she had no objections to
my wife being present, and gravely observing that &#8220;husbands
and wives were one, and should know all one another&#8217;s
secrets.&#8221; She stated that the public would look upon her
with horror and contempt, were it known she could speak
the Gipsy language. She was extremely civil and intelligent,
yet placed me upon a familiar equality with herself,
when she found I knew of the existence of her speech, and
could repeat some of the words of it. Her nature, to appearance,
seemed changed. Her bold and fiery disposition was
softened and subdued. She was very frank and polite; retained
her self-possession, and spoke with great propriety.<a name="FNanchor192" id="FNanchor192"></a><a href="#Footnote192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>
The words which I got on this occasion will be found in
another part of the chapter.</p>

<p>In corroboration of this principle of concealment observed
by the Scottish Gipsies, relative to their language, I may
give a fact which will show how artful they are in avoiding
any allusion to it. One evening, as a band of <i>potters</i>, with
a cart of earthenware, were travelling on the high-road, in
a wild glen in the south of Scotland, a brother of mine overheard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
them, male and female, conversing in a language, a
word of which he did not understand. As the road was
very bad, and the night dark, one of the females of the band
was a few yards in advance of the cart, acting as a guide to
the horde. Every now and then, among other unintelligible
expressions, she called out &#8220;<i>Shan drom</i>.&#8221; My brother&#8217;s
curiosity was excited by hearing the potters conversing in
this manner, and, next morning, he went to where they lodged,
in an out-house on the farm, and enquired of the female
what she was saying on the road, the night before, and what
she meant by &#8220;<i>Shan drom</i>.&#8221; The woman appeared confused
at the unexpected question; but in a short time recovered
her self-possession, and artfully replied that they
were talking <i>Latin</i> (<i>!</i>) and that &#8220;<i>Shan drom</i>,&#8221; in Latin,
signified &#8220;bad road.&#8221; But the truth is, &#8220;<i>Shan drom</i>&#8221; is
the Gipsy expression for bad road, as will by and by be seen.</p>

<p>Besides the difficulties mentioned in the way of getting
any of their language from them, there is a general one that
arises from the suspicious, unsettled, restless, fickle and volatile
nature by which they are characterized. It is a rare
thing to get them to speak consecutively for more than a
few minutes on any subject, thus precluding the possibility,
in most instances, of taking advantage of any favourable
humour in which they may be found, in the matter of their
general history&mdash;leaving alone the formal and serious procedure
necessary to be followed in regard to their language.
If this favourable turn in their disposition is allowed
to pass, it is rarely anything of that nature can be got from
them at that meeting; and it is extremely likely that, at
any after interviews, they will entirely evade the matter so
much desired.</p>

<p>With these remarks, I will now proceed to state the
method I adopted to get at the Gipsy language.</p>

<p>Short vocabularies of the language of the <i>Tschengenes</i> of
Turkey, the <i>Cyganis</i> of Hungary, the <i>Zigeuners</i> of Germany,
the <i>Gitanos</i> of Spain, and the <i>Gipsies</i> of England, have, at
different periods, since 1783, issued from the press, in this
country and in Germany; but I am not aware of any specimens
of our Scottish <i>Tinkler</i> or Gipsy language having as
yet been submitted to the public. Some of the former I
committed to memory, and used, intermixed with English
words, in questions I would put to the Scottish Gipsies. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
way, one word would lead to another. I would address them
in a confident and familiar manner, as if I were one of themselves,
and knew exactly who they were, and all about them.
I would, for instance, ask them: Have you a <i>grye</i> (horse)?
How many <i>chauvies</i> (children) have you? Where is your
<i>gaugie</i> (husband)? Do you sell <i>roys</i> (spoons)? Being
taken completely by surprise, they would give me at once a
true answer. For, being the first, as far as I know, to apply
the language of the Gipsies of the continent to our own
tribes, they could naturally have no hesitation in replying to
my questions; although they would wonder what kind of a
Gipsy I could possibly be&mdash;dressed, as I was, in black, with
black neck-cloth, and no display of linen, save a ruffled
breast, thick-soled shoes and gaiters. The consequence
was, I became a character of interest to many of the Gipsies
to be found in a circuit of many miles; and great wonder
was excited in their untutored minds, leading to a desire to
see, and know something of, the <i>Riah Nawken</i>, or the gentleman
Gipsy. On such occasions, I would treat them as I
would land a fish&mdash;give them hook and line enough. But
the circumstance was to them something incomprehensible,
for, although Gipsies are very ready-witted, and possess
great natural resources, in thieving, and playing tricks of
every kind, and great tact in getting out of difficulties of
that nature&mdash;which, with them, are matters of instinct, training,
and practice&mdash;their whole mind being bent, and exclusively
employed, in that direction, it was almost impossible
for them to form any intelligible opinion as to my true character,
provided I was any way discreet in disguising my real
position among them. As little chance was there of any of
themselves informing the others of what assistance they had
inadvertently been to me, in getting at their language.
Some of them might have an idea that one of their race had,
in their own way of thinking, peached, turned traitor to
their blood, and let the cat out of the bag. At times, if they
happened to see me approach them, so as to have an opportunity
to scrutinize me&mdash;which they are much given to, with
people generally&mdash;they would not be so easily disconcerted
at any question put to them in their language; but the result
would be either direct replies, or the most ludicrous
scenes of surprise and terror imaginable, which, to be enjoyed,
were only to be seen, but could not be described,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
although the sequel will in some measure illustrate them.
At other times, if I addressed a Gipsy in his own language,
and spoke to him in a kind and familiar manner, as if I had
been soothing a wild and unmanageable horse, before mounting
him, he would either very awkwardly pretend not to
understand what I meant, or, with a downcast and guilty
look, and subdued voice, immediately answer my Gipsy
words in English. But if I put the words to him in an abrupt,
hasty, or threatening manner, he would either take to
his heels, or turn upon me, like a tiger, and pour out upon
me a torrent of abusive language. The following instances
will show the manner in which my use of their language was
sometimes appreciated by the female Gipsies.</p>

<p>When I spoke in a sharp manner to some of the old women,
on the high-road, by way of testing them, they would
quicken their paces, look over their shoulders, and call out,
in much bitterness of spirit, &#8220;You are no gentleman, sir,
otherwise you would not insult us in that way.&#8221; On one
occasion, I observed a woman with her son, who appeared
about twelve years of age, lingering near a house at which
they had no business, and I desired her, rather sharply, to
leave the place, telling her that I was afraid her chauvie
was a <i>chor</i>&mdash;(that her son was a thief). I used these two
words merely to see what effect they would have upon her,
as I did not really think she was a Gipsy. She instantly
flew into a dreadful passion, telling me that I had been
among thieves and robbers myself, otherwise I could not
speak to her in such words as these. She threatened to go
to Edinburgh, to inform the police that I was the head and
captain of a band of thieves,<a name="FNanchor193" id="FNanchor193"></a><a href="#Footnote193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> and that she would have me
immediately apprehended as such. Four sailors who were
present with me were astonished at the sudden wrath and
insolence of the woman, as they could not perceive any provocation
she had received from me&mdash;being ignorant of the
meaning of the words <i>chauvie</i> and <i>chor</i>, which I applied to
her boy.</p>

<p>One day I fell in by chance, on a lonely part of the old
public road, on the hills within half a mile of the village of
North Queensferry, with a woman of about twenty-seven
years of age, and the mother, as she said, of seven children.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
She had light hair, blue eyes, and a fair complexion. The
youngest of her children appeared to be about nine months
old, and the eldest about ten years. The mother was dressed
in a brown cloak, and the group had altogether a very
squalid appearance. In the most lamentable tone of voice,
she informed me that her husband had set off with another
woman, and left her and her seven children to starve; and
that he had been lately employed at a paper-mill in Mid-Lothian.
She sometimes appeared almost to choke with
grief, but, nevertheless, I observed no tears in her eyes. She
often repeated, in a sort of hypocritical and canting manner,
&#8220;The Lord has been very kind to me, and will still protect
me and my helpless babes. Last night we all slept in
the open fields, and gathered peas and beans from the stubble
for our suppers.&#8221; She certainly seemed to be in very indigent
circumstances; but that her husband had abandoned
her, I did not credit. However, I gave her a few half-pence,
for which she thanked me very civilly. From her extravagant
behaviour, and a peculiar wildness in her looks, it occurred
to me that she belonged to the lowest caste of Gipsies,
although her appearance did not indicate it; that her grief
was, for the most part, feigned, and that the story of her
husband having abandoned her was got up merely to excite
pity, for the purpose of procuring a little money for the subsistence
of her band. I now put a number of questions to
her, relative to many individuals whom I knew were Gipsies
of a superior class, taking care not to call them by that name,
in case of alarming her. I spoke to her as if I had been
quite intimate with all the persons I was enquiring about.
She gave me satisfactory answers to almost every question,
and seemed well acquainted with every individual I named.
She now appeared quite calm and collected, and answered
me very gravely. But she said that some of the men I mentioned
were rogues, and that their wives played many clever
tricks. On mentioning the tricks of the wives, I noticed a
smile come over her countenance. I observed to her that
they were not faultless, but that they were often blamed for
crimes of which they were not guilty. Upon perceiving that
I took their part, which I did on purpose, to hear what she
would say, she gradually changed her mind, and came over
to my opinion. She said that they were exceedingly good-hearted
people, and that some of them had frequently paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
a night&#8217;s lodging for herself and family. I now ventured to
put a question to her, half in Gipsy and half in English.
After a short pause and hesitation, she signified that she understood
what I said. I then asked one or two questions
in Gipsy words only. A Gipsy, with crockery-ware in a
basket, happened to pass us at the very moment I was speaking
to her; and to show her the knowledge I had of her
speech and people, I said, &#8220;There is a <i>nawken</i>&#8220;&mdash;(there is a
Gipsy.) She, in a very civil and polite manner, immediately
replied, &#8220;Sir, I hope you will not take it ill, when I use the
freedom of saying that you must have been among the people
you are enquiring about, otherwise you could not speak to
me in that way.&#8221; To show her that I did not despise her
for understanding my Gipsy words, I gave her a few pence
more, and spoke kindly to her. She then became quite
cheerful and frank, as if we had been old acquaintances.
Instead of trying to impose upon me, by tales of grief and
woe, and feigned piety, she appeared happy and contented,
her whole conduct indicating that it was useless to play off
her tricks upon me, as she was now sensible that I knew exactly
what she was, and yet did not treat her contemptuously.
She said her husband&#8217;s name was Wilson, and her
own Jackson, (the names of two Gipsy tribes;) that she could
tell fortunes, and was acquainted with the <i>Irish</i> words I
spoke, being afraid to call them by their right name. She
further stated that every one of the people I was enquiring
about spoke in the same language.</p>

<p>About half an hour after I parted with her, on the road,
I met her in the village of North Queensferry, while I was
walking with a friend. I then put a question to her in
Gipsy words, in the presence of this third party, who knew
not what she was, to see how she would conduct herself in
public. She seemed surprised at my question, as if she did
not understand a word of it&mdash;to prevent it being discovered
to others of the community that she was a Gipsy. But she
publicly praised me highly, for having given her something
to help her poor children; and, with her trumped-up story
at her tongue&#8217;s end, proceeded on her travels.</p>

<p>These poor people were much alarmed when I let them
see that I knew they were Gipsies. They thought I was
despising them, and treating them with contempt; or they
were afraid of being apprehended under the old sanguinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
laws, condemning the whole unfortunate race to death; for
the Gipsies, as I have already said, still believe that these
bloody statutes are in full force against them at the present
day.</p>

<p>I was advised by Sir Walter Scott, as mentioned in the
<a href="#Page_55">Introduction</a>, to &#8220;get the same words from different individuals;
and, to verify the collection, to set down the names of
the persons by whom they were communicated;&#8221; which I
have done. For this reason, the words now furnished will
appear as the confessions of so many individuals, rather than
a vocabulary drawn up in the manner in which such is usually
done; and which will be more satisfactory to the general
reader, as well as the philologist, than if I had presented
the words by themselves, without any positive or circumstantial
evidence of their genuineness. To the general
reader, as distinguished from the philologist, the anecdotes
connected with the collection may prove interesting, if the
words themselves have no attraction for him; while they
will satisfy the latter, as far as they go, as to the existence
of a language which has almost always been denied, yet
which is known, at the present day, to a greater number of
the population of the country than could at first have been
imagined; this part of it having been drawn from a variety
of individuals, at different and widely-separated times and
places. On this account, I hope that the minuteness of the
details of the present enquiry may not appear tedious, but,
on the contrary, interesting, to my readers generally; inasmuch
as the present collection is the first, as far as I know,
of the Scottish Gipsy language that has ever been made;
although the people themselves have lived amongst us for
three hundred and fifty years, and talked it every hour of
the day, but hardly ever in the hearing of the other inhabitants,
excepting, occasionally, a word of it now and then, to
disguise their discourse from those around them; which, on
being questioned, they have always passed off for <i>cant</i>, to
prevent the law taking hold of them, and punishing them
for being Gipsies. These details will also show that our
Scottish Tinklers, or Gipsies, are sprung from the common
stock from which are descended those that are to be found
in the other parts of Europe, as well as those that are scattered
over the world generally; what secrecy they observe
in all matters relative to their affairs; what an extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
degree of reluctance and fear they evince in answering
questions tending to develop their history; and, consequently,
how difficult it is to learn anything satisfactory
about them.<a name="FNanchor194" id="FNanchor194"></a><a href="#Footnote194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>I fell in one day, on the public road, with an old woman
and her two daughters, of the name of Ross, selling horn
spoons, made by Andrew Stewart, a Tinkler at Bo&#8217;ness. I
repeated to the woman, in the shape of questions, some of
the Gipsy words presented in these pages. She at first
affected, though very awkwardly, not to understand what I
said, but in a few minutes, with some embarrassment in her
manner, acknowledged that she knew the speech, and gave
me the English of the following words:</p>

<ul class="words">
<li><i>Gaugie</i>, man.</li>
<li><i>Managie</i>, woman.</li>
<li><i>Chauvies</i>, children.</li>
<li><i>Grye</i>, horse.</li>
<li><i>Grye-femler</i>, horse-dealer.</li>
<li><i>Roys</i>, spoons.</li>
</ul>

<p>I observed to this woman, that I saw no harm in speaking
this language openly and publicly. &#8220;None in the least, sir,&#8221;
was her reply.</p>

<p>Two girls, of the name of Jamieson, came one day begging
to my door. They appeared to be sisters, of about
eight and seventeen years of age, and were pretty decently
clothed. Both had light-blue eyes, light-yellow, or rather
flaxen, hair, and fair complexions. To ascertain whether
they were Tinklers or not, I put some Gipsy words to the
eldest girl. She immediately hung down her head, as if she
had been detected in a crime, and, pretending not to understand
what was said, left the house; but, after proceeding
about twelve paces, she took courage, turned round, and,
with a smile upon an agreeable countenance, called back,
&#8220;There are eleven of us, sir.&#8221; I had enquired of her how
many children there were of her family. I called both the
girls back to my house, and ordered them some victuals, for
which they were extremely grateful, and seemed much
pleased that they were kindly treated. After I had discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
they were Gipsies, I wormed out of them the following
words:</p>

<ul class="words">
<li><i>Gaugie</i>, man.</li>
<li><i>Managie</i>, woman.</li>
<li><i>Chauvies</i>, children.</li>
<li><i>Grye</i>, horse.</li>
<li><i>Jucal</i>, dog.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I enquired of the eldest girl the English of <i>Jucal</i>,
she did not, at first, catch the sound of the word; but her
little sister looked up in her face, and said to her, &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you hear? That is dog. It is dog he means.&#8221; The other
then added, with a downcast look, and a melancholy tone
of voice, &#8220;You gentlemen understand all languages now-a-days.&#8221;</p>

<p>At another time, four or five children were loitering about,
and diverting themselves, before the door of a house, near
Inverkeithing. The youngest appeared about five, and the
eldest about thirteen years of age. One of the boys, of the
name of McDonald, stepped forward, and asked some money
from me in charity. From his importunate manner of begging,
I suspected the children were Gipsies, although their
appearance did not indicate them to be of that race. After
some questions put to them about their parents and their
occupations, they gave me the English of the following
words:</p>

<ul class="words">
<li><i>Gaugie</i>, man.</li>
<li><i>Chauvies</i>, children.</li>
<li><i>Riah</i>, gentleman.</li>
<li><i>Grye</i>, horse.</li>
<li><i>Jucal</i>, dog.</li>
<li><i>Aizel</i>, ass.</li>
<li><i>Lowa</i>, silver.</li>
<li><i>Chor</i>, thief.</li>
<li><i>Staurdie</i>, prison.</li>
<li><i>Bing</i>, the devil.</li>
</ul>

<p>A gentleman, an acquaintance of mine, was in my presence
while the children were answering my words; and as the
subject of their language was new to him, I made some remarks
to him in their hearing, relative to their tribe, which
greatly displeased them. One of the boys called out to me,
with much bitterness of expression, &#8220;You are a Gipsy yourself,
sir, or you never could have got these words.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some years since, a female, of the name of Ruthven, was
in the habit of calling at a farm occupied by one of my
brothers. My mother, being interested about the Gipsies,
began, on one occasion, to question this female Tinkler, relative
to her tribe, and, among other things, asked if she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
a Gipsy. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Ruthven, &#8220;I am a Gipsy, and a
desperate, murdering race we are. I will let you hear me
speak our language, but what the better will you be of
that?&#8221; She accordingly uttered a few sentences, and then
said, &#8220;Now, are you any the wiser of what you have heard?
But that infant,&#8221; pointing to her child of about five years of
age, &#8220;understands every word I speak.&#8221; &#8220;I know,&#8221; continued
the Tinkler, &#8220;that the public are trying to find out
the secrets of the Gipsies, but it is in vain.&#8221; This woman
further stated that her tribe would be exceedingly displeased,
were it known that any of their fraternity taught
their language to &#8220;strangers.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor195" id="FNanchor195"></a><a href="#Footnote195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> She also mentioned that the
Gipsies believe that the laws which were enacted for their
extirpation were yet in full force against them. I may mention,
however, that she could put confidence in the family in
whose house she made these confessions.</p>

<p>On another occasion, a female, with three or four children,
the eldest of whom was not above ten years of age, came
up to me while speaking to an innkeeper, on a public pier
on the banks of the Forth. She stated to us that her property
had been burned to the ground, and her family reduced
to beggary, and solicited charity of us both. After receiving
a few half-pence from the innkeeper, she continued her
importunities with an unusual impertinence, and hung upon
me for a contribution. Her barefaced conduct displeased
me. I thought I would put her to the test, and try if she
was not a Gipsy. Deepening the tone of my voice, I called
out to her, in an angry manner, &#8220;<i>Sallah, jaw drom</i>&#8220;&mdash;(&#8220;Curse
you, take the road.&#8221;) The woman instantly wheeled
about, uttered not another word, but set off, with precipitation;
and so alarmed were her children, that they took hold
of her clothes, to hasten and pull her out of my presence;
calling to her, at the same time, &#8220;Mother, mother, come
away.&#8221; Mine host, the innkeeper, was amazed at the effectual
manner in which I silenced and dismissed the importunate
and troublesome beggars. He was anxious that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
should teach him the unknown words that had so terrified
the poor Gipsies; with the design, it appeared to me, of
frightening others, should they molest him with their begging.
Had I not proved this family by the language, it was
impossible for any one to perceive that the group were
Gipsies.</p>

<p>In prosecuting my enquiries into the existence of the
Gipsy language, I paid a visit to Lochgellie, once the residence
of four or five families of Gipsies, as already mentioned,
and procured an interview with young Andrew
Steedman, a member of the tribe. At first, he appeared
much alarmed, and seemed to think I had a design to do
him harm. His fears, however, were in a short while
calmed; and, after much reluctance, he gave me the following
words and expressions, with the corresponding English
significations. Like a true Gipsy, the first expression which
he uttered, as if it came the readiest to him, was, &#8220;<i>Choar a
chauvie</i>&#8220;&mdash;(&#8220;rob that person&#8221;) which he pronounced with a
smile on his countenance.</p>

<ul class="words">
<li><i>Gaugie</i>, man.</li>
<li><i>Gourie</i>, man.</li>

<p>The first expression which the Gipsies use in saluting one
another, when they first meet, anywhere, is &#8220;<i>Auteenie, auteenie</i>.&#8221;
Steedman, however, did not give me the English
of this salutation. He stated to me that, at the present day,
the Gipsies in Scotland, when by themselves, transact their
business in their own language, and hold all their ordinary
conversations in the same speech. In the course of a few
minutes, Steedman&#8217;s fears returned upon him. He appeared
to regret what he had done. He now said he had forgotten
the language, and referred me to his father, old Andrew
Steedman, who, he said, would give me every information I
might require. I imprudently sent him out, to bring the old
man to me; for, when both returned, all further communication,
with regard to their speech, was at an end. Both
were now dead silent on the subject, denied all knowledge
of the Gipsy language, and were evidently under great
alarm. The old man would not face me at all; and when I
went to him, he appeared to be shaking and trembling, while
he stood at the head of his horses, in his own stable. Young
Steedman entreated me to tell no one that he had given me
any words, as the Tinklers, he said, would be exceedingly
displeased with him for doing so. This man, however, by
being kindly treated, and seeing no intention of doing him
any harm, became, at an after period, communicative on
various subjects relative to the Gipsies.</p>

<p>The following are the words which I obtained during an

<p>I observed to this woman that her language would, in
course of time, be lost. She replied, with great seriousness,
&#8220;It will never be forgotten, sir; it is in our hearts, and
as long as a single Tinkler exists, it will be remembered.&#8221;
I further enquired of her, how many of her tribe were in
Scotland. Her answer was, &#8220;There are several thousand;
and there are many respectable shop-keepers and house-holders
in Scotland that are Gipsies.&#8221; I requested of this
woman the Gipsy word for God.<a name="FNanchor196" id="FNanchor196"></a><a href="#Footnote196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> She said they had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
corresponding word for God in their speech; adding, that
she thought &#8220;it as well, as it prevented them having their
Maker&#8217;s name often unnecessarily and sinfully in their
mouths.&#8221; She acknowledged the justice, and highly approved
of the punishment of death for murder; but she
condemned, most bitterly, the law that took away the lives
of human beings for stealing. She dwelt on the advantages
which her secret speech gave her tribe in transacting business
in markets. She said that she was descended from the
first Gipsy family in Scotland. I was satisfied that she was
sprung from the second, if not the first, family. I could
make out, with tolerable certainty, the links of her descent
for four generations of Gipsies. I have already described
the splendid style in which her ancestors travelled in Tweed-dale.
Her mother, above eighty years of age, also called
at my house. Both were fortune-tellers. It was evident,
from this woman&#8217;s manner, that she knew much she would
not communicate. Like the Gipsy chief, in presence of Dr.
Bright, at Csurgo, in Hungary, she, in a short time, became
impatient; and, apparently, when a certain hour arrived, she
insisted upon being allowed to depart. She would not submit
to be questioned any longer.</p>

<p>Owing to the nature of my enquiries, and more particularly
the fears of the tribe, I could seldom venture to question
the Gipsies regarding their speech, or their ancient
customs, with any hope of receiving satisfactory answers,
when a third party was present. The following, however,
is an instance to the contrary; and the facts witnessed by
the gentleman who was with me at the time, are, besides
the testimony of the Gipsies themselves, convincing proofs
that these people, at the present day, in Scotland, can converse
among themselves, on any ordinary subject, in their
own language, without making use of a single word of the
English tongue.<a name="FNanchor197" id="FNanchor197"></a><a href="#Footnote197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>In May, 1829, while near the manse of Inverkeithing, my
friend and I accidentally fell in, on the high road, with four
children, the youngest of whom appeared to be about four,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
and the eldest about thirteen, years of age. They were accompanied
by a woman, about twenty years old, who had the
appearance of being married, but not the mother of any of
the children with her. Not one of the whole party could
have been taken for a Gipsy, but all had the exact appearance
of being the family of some indigent tradesman or labourer.
Excepting the woman, whose hair was dark, all of the company
had hair of a light colour, some of them inclining to
yellow, with fair complexions. In not one of their countenances
could be seen those features by which many pretend
the Gipsies can, at all times, be distinguished from the rest
of the community. The manner, however, in which the
woman, at first, addressed me, created in my mind a suspicion
that she was one of the tribe. In order to ascertain the
fact, I put a question to her in Gipsy, in such a manner that
it might appear to her that I was quite certain she was one
of the fraternity. She immediately smiled at my question,
held down her head, cast her eyes to the ground, then appeared
as if she had been detected in something wrong, and
pretended not to understand what I said. One of the children,
however, being thrown entirely off his guard, immediately
said to her, &#8220;You know quite well what he says.&#8221;
The woman, recovering from her surprise and confusion, and
being assured she had nothing to fear from me, now answered
my question. She also replied to every other interrogation
I put to her, without showing the least fear or hesitation.
After I had repeated a few words more, and a sentence in
the Gipsy tongue, one of the boys exclaimed, &#8220;He has good
cant!&#8221; and then addressed me entirely in the Gipsy language.
(All the Gipsies, as I have already mentioned, call their language
<i>cant</i>, for the purpose of concealing their tribe.) The
whole party seemed extremely happy that I was acquainted
with their speech. The woman put several questions to me,
in return, some of which were wholly in her own peculiar
tongue. She asked my name, place of residence, and whether
I was a <i>nawken</i>&mdash;that is a Gipsy. She further enquired
whether my friend was also a <i>nawken</i>; adding, with a smile,
that she was sure I was a <i>tramper</i>. The children sometimes
conversed among themselves wholly in their own language;
and, when I could not understand the woman, as
she requested, in her own speech, to know my name, &amp;c.,
one of them instantly interpreted the sentence into English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
for me. One of the oldest boys, however, thinking I was
only pretending to be ignorant of their speech, observed, in
English, to his companions, &#8220;I am sure he is a tramper, and
can speak as good cant as any of us.&#8221; To keep up the character,
my friend told them that I had been a tramper in my
youth, but that I had now nearly lost the language. On
hearing this, the woman, with great earnestness, exclaimed,
&#8220;God bless the gentleman!&#8221; In order to confirm their belief
that I was one of their tribe, I bade the woman good-day
in her own tongue, and parted with them. She informed
me, on leaving, that she resided at Banff, but that her husband
was then at Perth.</p>

<p>During the short interview which I had with these Gipsies,
I collected the following words:</p>

<ul class="words">
<li><i>Gaugie</i>, man.</li>
<li><i>Riah</i>, gentleman.</li>
<li><i>Raunie</i>, lady.</li>
<li><i>Vast</i>, hand.</li>
<li><i>Sonnakie</i>, gold.</li>
<li><i>Sonnakie vanister</i>, gold ring.</li>
<li><i>Roug</i>, silver.</li>
<li><i>Lowie</i>, money.</li>
<li><i>Grye</i>, horse.</li>
<li><i>Aizel</i>, ass.</li>
<li><i>Jucal</i>, dog.</li>
<li><i>Matchka</i>, cat.</li>
<li><i>Baurie</i>, great.</li>
<li><i>Vile</i>, village.</li>
<li><i>Baurie vile</i>, large village.</li>
<li><i>Nawken</i>, Gipsy.</li>
<li><i>Davies</i>, day.</li>
<li><i>Beenship davies</i>, <i>Nawken</i>, good-day, Gipsy.</li>
<li><i>Pen yer naam?</i> what is your name?</li>
<li><i>Shucha</i>, coat.</li>
<li><i>Calshes</i>, breeches.</li>
<li><i>Gogle</i>, hat.</li>
<li><i>Coories</i>, blankets.</li>
<li><i>Roys</i>, spoons.</li>
<li><i>Skews</i>, platters.</li>
<li><i>Habben kairer</i>, baker of bread.</li>
</ul>

<p>The method I adopted with them, as I have already
hinted, was to ask them the English of the words I gave
them in Gipsy, so that the answers I got were confirmations
of the same words collected from other individuals, and
which I drew from memory for the occasion. Had I attempted
to write down any of their sentences, it would have
instantly shut the door to all further conversation on the
subject, and, in all probability, the Gipsies would have taken
to their heels, muttering imprecations against me for having
insulted them. Of this I was satisfied, that had I really been
acquainted with their speech, these Gipsy children could
have kept up a regular and connected conversation with me,
with the greatest fluency, and without their sentences being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
intermixed with any English or Scotch words whatever, a
fact which has been repeatedly stated to me by the Gipsies.</p>

<p>In confirmation of these facts, I shall transcribe a letter
addressed to me by the gentleman who was present on the
occasion.<a name="FNanchor198" id="FNanchor198"></a><a href="#Footnote198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p class="letterright"><span class="smcap">Inverkeithing</span>, <i>25th May, 1829.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>:
</p>

<p>&#8220;Agreeably to your desire, I have looked over that part
of your manuscript of the Scottish Gipsies which details the
particulars of a short and accidental interview which we
had with a woman and four children, whom we met near
Inverkeithing Manse, on the 22d inst., and who turned out
to be Gipsies. I have no hesitation in averring that your
statements, to my knowledge, are substantially correct&mdash;being
present during the whole conversation which took
place with the individuals mentioned. It was the first time
I ever heard the Gipsy language spoken, and it appeared
quite evident that those Gipsies could converse, in a regular
and connected manner, on any subject, without making use
of a single English word; and which particularly appeared
from the questions which they put to you, as well as from
the conversation which they had among themselves, in their
own peculiar speech: and that, otherwise, the woman and
children had not, in the colour of their hair, complexion, and
general appearance, any resemblance to those people whom
I always considered to be Gipsies. I am, &amp;c.,</p>

<p class="letterright">
&#8220;JAMES H. COBBAN,<br />
<i>Deputy Compt. of Customs, Inverkeithing.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="letterleft">

<i>Supt. of Quarantine, Inverkeithing</i>.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor199" id="FNanchor199"></a><a href="#Footnote199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a><br />
</p>

<p>I have already mentioned having succeeded in obtaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
a few words of Gipsy, from two sisters, of the name of Jamieson,
who came begging to my door. I had reason to suppose
they would acquaint their relatives of having been
questioned in their own speech, and would greatly exaggerate
my knowledge of it; for I always observed that the individuals
with whom I conversed were at first impressed with a
belief that I knew much more of it than I really did.</p>

<p>During the following summer, a brother and a cousin of
these girls called at my house, selling baskets. The one
was about twenty-one, the other fifteen, years of age. I
happened to be from home, but one of my family, suspecting
them to be Gipsies, invited them into the house, and mentioned
to them, (although very incorrectly,) that I understood
every word of their speech. &#8220;So I saw,&#8221; replied the eldest
lad, &#8220;for when he passed us on the road, some time ago, I
called, in our language, to my neighbour, to come out of the
way, and he understood what I said, for he immediately
turned round, and looked at us.&#8221; I, however, knew nothing
of the circumstance; I did not even recollect having seen
them pass me. It is likely, however, I had been examining
their appearance, and it is as likely they had been trying if
I understood their speech. At all events, they appeared to
have known me, while I was entirely ignorant of who they
were, and to have had their curiosity excited, on account, as
I imagined, of their relatives having told them I was acquainted
with their language. This occurrence produced a
wonderful effect upon the two lads, for they appeared pleased
to think I could speak their language. At this moment, one
of my daughters, about seven years of age, repeated, in their
hearing, the Gipsy word for pot, having picked it up from
hearing me mention it. The young Tinklers now thought
they were in the midst of a Gipsy family, and seemed quite
happy. &#8220;But are you really a <i>nawken</i>?&#8221; I asked the eldest
of them. &#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; he replied; &#8220;and to show you
I am no impostor, I will give you the names of everything
in your house;&#8221; which, in the presence of my family, he
did, to the extent I asked of him. &#8220;My speech,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;is not the cant of packmen, nor the slang of common
thieves.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Gipsy-hunting is like deer-stalking. In prosecuting
it, it is necessary to know the animal, its habits, and the
locality in which it is to be found. I saw the unfavourable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
turn approaching: the Gipsies&#8217; time was up; their patience
was exhausted. I dropped the subject, and ordered them
some refreshment. On their taking leave of me, I said to
them, &#8220;Do you intend coming round this part of the country
again?&#8221; (I need not have asked them such a question as
that.) &#8220;That we do, sir; and we will not fail to come and
see you again.&#8221; They thus left me, with the strong impression
on their minds, that I was a <i>nawken</i>, like themselves,
but a <i>riah</i>&mdash;a gentleman Gipsy. I waited patiently for
their return, which would happen in due season, on their
half-yearly <i>tramp</i>. Everything looked so favourably, circumstances
had contributed so fortunately, to the end which
I had so much at heart, that I looked upon the information
to be drawn from these poor Tinkler lads, with as much
solicitude and avarice as one would who had discovered a
treasure hid in his field.</p>

<p>This species of Gipsy-hunting, I believe, I had exclusively
to myself. I had none of the difficulties to contend with,
which would be implied in the field of it having been gone
over by others before me. That kind of Gipsy-hunting
which implied imprisonment, banishment, and hanging, was
a thing of which the Gipsies had had sad experience; if not
in their own persons, at least in that which the traditions
of their tribe had so carefully handed down to them. Besides
this, the experience of the daily life of the members
of their tribe afforded an excellent school of training, for
acquiring a host of expedients for escaping every danger
and difficulty to which their habits exposed them. But so
thoroughly had they preserved their secrets, and especially
the grand one&mdash;their language&mdash;that they came to their
wits&#8217; end how to understand, and how to act in, the new
sphere of danger into which they were now thrown, or even
to comprehend its nature. Such was the advantage which
education and enlightenment had given their civilized neighbour
over them. How could <i>they</i> imagine that the commencement
of my knowledge of their language had been
drawn from <i>books</i>? What did some of them know of <i>books</i>,
beyond, perhaps, a youth sent to school, where, owing to his
restless and unsettled good-for-nothingness, he would advance
little beyond his alphabet?<a name="FNanchor200" id="FNanchor200"></a><a href="#Footnote200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> For we know that some Gipsies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
are so intensely vain as to send a child to school, merely
to brag before their civilized neighbours that their children
have been educated. How could <i>they</i> comprehend that
<i>their</i> language had found, or could find, its way into <i>books</i>?
The thing to them was impossible; the idea of it could
not, by any exertion of their own, even enter into their
imagination. The danger to arise from such a quarter was
altogether beyond their capacity of comprehension. Knowing,
however, that there was danger of some singular nature
surrounding them, yet being unable to comprehend it,
they flickered about it, like moths about a candle; till at
last they did come to comprehend, if not its origin, or extent,
at least its tendency, and the consequences to which it
would lead.</p>

<p>According to promise, the eldest of the Gipsy boys called
at my house, in about six months, accompanied by his sister.
He was selling white-iron ware, for he was a tin-smith by
occupation. Without entering into any preliminary conversation,
for the purpose of smoothing the way for more direct
questions, I took him into my parlour, and at once enquired
if he <i>could</i> speak the Tinkler language? He applied to my
question the construction that I doubted if he could, and the
consequences which that would imply, and answered firmly,
&#8220;Yes, sir; I have been bred in that line all my life.&#8221; &#8220;Will
you allow me,&#8221; said I, &#8220;to write down your words?&#8221; &#8220;O yes,
sir; you are welcome to as many as you please.&#8221; &#8220;Have you
names for everything, and can you converse on any subject,
in that language?&#8221; &#8220;Yes, sir; we can converse, and have a
name for everything, in our own speech.&#8221; I now commenced
to &#8220;make hay while the sun shone,&#8221; as the phrase runs; for
I knew that I could have only about an hour with the Gipsy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
at the most. The following, then, are the words and sentences
which I took down, on this occasion:</p>

<p>This young man sang part of two Gipsy songs to me, in
English; and then, at my request, he turned one of them
into the Gipsy language, intermingled a little, however,
with English words; occasioned, perhaps, by the difficulty
in translating it. The subject of one of the songs was that
of celebrating a robbery, committed upon a Lord Shandos;
and the subject of the other was a description of a Gipsy
battle. The courage with which the females stood the rattle
of the cudgels upon their heads was much lauded in the song.
Like the Gipsy woman with whom I had no less than seven
years&#8217; trouble ere getting any of her speech, this Gipsy lad
became, in about an hour&#8217;s time, very restless, and impatient
to be gone. The true state of things, in this instance,
dawned upon his mind. He now became much alarmed, and
would neither allow me to write down his songs, nor stop
to give me any more of his words and sentences. His
terror was only exceeded by his mortification; and, on parting
with me, he said that, had he, at first, been aware I was
unacquainted with his speech, he would not have given me
a word of it.</p>

<p>As far as I can judge, from the few and short specimens
which I have myself heard, and had reported to me, the
subjects of the songs of the Scottish Gipsies, (I mean those
composed by themselves,) are chiefly their plunderings, their
robberies, and their sufferings. The numerous and deadly
conflicts which they had among themselves, also, afforded
them themes for the exercise of their muse. My father, in
his youth, often heard them singing songs, wholly in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
own language. They appear to have been very fond of our
ancient Border marauding songs, which celebrate the daring
exploits of the lawless freebooters on the frontiers of Scotland
and England. They were constantly singing these compositions
among themselves. The song composed on Hughie
Gr&aelig;me, the horse-stealer, published in the second volume of
Sir Walter Scott&#8217;s Border Minstrelsy, was a great favourite
with the Tinklers. As this song is completely to the taste
of a Gipsy, I will insert it in this place, as affording a
good specimen of that description of song in the singing of
which they take great delight. It will also serve to show
the peculiar cast of mind of the Gipsies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>I will now give the testimony of the Gipsy chief from
whom I received the &#8220;blowing up&#8221; alluded to, by Mr. Laidlaw,
in the <a href="#Page_55">Introduction</a> to the work.<a name="FNanchor202" id="FNanchor202"></a><a href="#Footnote202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>One of the greatest fairs in Scotland is held, annually, on
the 18th day of July, at St. Boswell&#8217;s Green, in Roxburghshire.
I paid a visit to this fair, for the purpose of taking
a view of the Gipsies. An acquaintance, whom I met at
the fair, observed to me, that he was sure if any one could
give me information regarding the Tinklers, it would be old &mdash;&mdash;,
the horner, at &mdash;&mdash;. To ensure a kind reception from
the Gipsies, it was agreed upon, between us, that I should
introduce myself by mentioning who my ancestors were, on
whose numerous farms, (sixteen, rented by my grandfather,
in 1781,<a name="FNanchor203" id="FNanchor203"></a><a href="#Footnote203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>) their forefathers had received many a night&#8217;s
quarters, in their out-houses. We soon found out the old
chieftain, sitting in a tent, in the midst of about a dozen of
his tribe, all nearly related to him. The moment I made
myself known to them, the whole of the old persons immediately
expressed their gratitude for the humane treatment
they, and their forefathers, had received at the farms of my
relatives. They were extremely glad to see me; and &#8220;God
bless you,&#8221; was repeated by several of the old females. &#8220;Ay,&#8221;
said they, &#8220;those days are gone. Christian charity has now
left the land. We know the people are growing more hard
and uncharitable every year.&#8221; I found the old man shrewd,
sensible, and intelligent; far beyond what could have been
expected from a person of his caste and station in life. He,
besides, possessed all that merriness and jocularity which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
have often observed among a number of the males of his
race. After some conversation with this chief, who appeared
about eighty years of age, I enquired if his people, who, in
large bands, about sixty years ago, traversed the south of
Scotland, had not an ancient language, peculiar to themselves.
He hesitated a little, and then readily replied, that
the Tinklers had no language of their own, except a few
cant words. I observed to him that he knew better&mdash;that
the Tinklers had, beyond dispute, a language of their own;
and that I had some knowledge of its existence at the present
day. He, however, declared that they had no such language,
and that I was wrongly informed. In the hearing
of all the Gipsies in the tent, I repeated to him four or five
Gipsy words and expressions. At this he appeared amazed;
and on my adding some particulars relative to some of the
ancestors of the tribe then present, enumerating, I think,
three generations of their clan, one of the old females exclaimed,
&#8220;Preserve me, he kens a&#8217; about us!&#8221; The old
chief immediately took hold of my right hand, below the
table, with a grasp as if he were going to shake it: and, in
a low and subdued tone of voice, so as none might near but
myself, requested me to say not another word in the place
where we were sitting, but to call on him, at the town of &mdash;&mdash;,
and he would converse with me on that subject. I
considered it imprudent to put any more questions to him
relative to his speech, on this occasion, and agreed to meet
him at the place he appointed.</p>

<p>Several persons in the tent, (it being one of the public
booths in the market,) who were not Gipsies, were equally
surprised, when they observed an understanding immediately
take place between me and the Tinklers, by means of a few
words, the meaning of which they could not comprehend. A
farmer, from the south of Scotland, who was present in the
tent, and had that morning given the Tinklers a lamb to eat,
met me, some days after, on the banks of the Yarrow. He
shook his head, and observed, with a smile, &#8220;Yon was queer-looking
wark wi&#8217; the Tinklers.&#8221;</p>

<p>As I was anxious to penetrate to his secret speech, I resolved
to keep the appointment with the Gipsy, whatever
might be the result of our meeting, and I therefore proceeded
to the town which he mentioned, eleven days after I had
seen him at the fair. On enquiring of the landlord of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
principal inn, at which I put up my horse, where the house
of &mdash;&mdash;, the Tinkler, was situated in the town, he appeared
surprised, and eyed me all over. He told me the street, but
said he would not accompany me to the house, thinking that
I wished him to go with me. It was evident that the landlord,
whom I never saw before, considered himself in bad
company, in spite of my black clothes, black neck-cloth, and
ruffles aforesaid, and was determined not to be seen on the
street, either with me or the Tinkler. I told him I by no
means wished him to accompany me, but only to tell me in
what part of the town the Tinkler&#8217;s house was to be found.</p>

<p>On entering the house, I found the old chief sitting, without
his coat, with an old night-cap on his head, a leathern
apron around his waist, and all covered with dust or soot,
employed in making spoons from horn. After conversing
with him for a short time, I reminded him of the ancient
language with which he was acquainted. He assumed a
grave countenance, and said the Tinklers had no such language,
adding, at the same time, that I should not trouble
myself about such matters. He stoutly denied all knowledge
of the Tinkler language, and said no such tongue existed in
Scotland, except a few cant words. I persisted in asserting
that they were actually in possession of a secret language,
and again tried him with a few of my words; but to no purpose.
All my efforts produced no effect upon his obstinacy.
At this stage of my interview, I durst not mention the word
Gipsy, as they are exceedingly alarmed at being known as
Gipsies. I now signified that he had forfeited his promise,
given me at the fair, and rose to leave him. At this remark,
I heard a man burst out a-laughing, behind a partition that
ran across the apartment in which we were sitting. The
old man likewise started to his feet, and, with both his sooty
hands, took hold of the breast of my coat, on either side,
and, in this attitude, examined me closely, scanning me all
over from head to foot. After satisfying himself, he said,
&#8220;Now, give me a hold of your hand&mdash;farewell&mdash;I will know
you when I see you again.&#8221; I bade him good-day, and left
the house.<a name="FNanchor204" id="FNanchor204"></a><a href="#Footnote204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>I had now no hope of obtaining any information from this
man, regarding his peculiar language. I had scarcely, however,
proceeded a hundred yards down the street, from the
house, when I was overtaken by a young female, who requested
me to return, to speak with her father. I immediately
complied. On reaching the door, with the girl, I
met one of the old man&#8217;s sons, who said that he had overheard
what passed between his father and me, in the house.
He assured me that his father <i>was ashamed to give me his
language</i>; but that, if I would promise not to publish their
names, or place of residence, he would himself give me some
of their speech, if his father still persevered in his refusal.
I accordingly agreed not to make public the names, and place
of residence, of the family. I again entered the little factory
of horn spoons. Matters were now, to all appearance,
quite changed. The old man was very cheerful, and seemed
full of mirth. &#8220;Come away,&#8221; said he; &#8220;what is this you
are asking after? I would advise you to go to Mr. Stewart,
at Hawick, and he will tell you everything about our language.&#8221;
&#8220;Father,&#8221; said the son, who had resumed his place
behind the partition before mentioned, &#8220;you know that Mr.
Stewart will give our speech to nobody.&#8221; The old chief
again hesitated and considered, but, being urged by his son
and myself, he, at last, said, &#8220;Come away, then; I will tell
you whatever you think proper to ask me. I gave you my
oath, at the fair, to do so. Get out your paper, pen and ink,
and begin.&#8221; He gave me no other oath, at the fair, than his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
word, and taking me by the hand, that he would converse
with me regarding the speech of the Tinklers. But, I believe,
joining hands is considered an oath in some countries
of the Eastern world. I was fully convinced, however, that
he was <i>ashamed to give me his speech</i>, and that it was with
the greatest reluctance he spoke one word on the subject.
The following are the words and sentences which I collected
from him:<a name="FNanchor205" id="FNanchor205"></a><a href="#Footnote205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>I was desirous to learn, from this Gipsy, if there were any
traditions among the Scottish Gipsies, as to their origin,
and the country from which they came. He stated that the
language of which he had given me a specimen was an Ethiopian
dialect, used by a tribe of thieves and robbers; and
that the Gipsies were originally from Ethiopia, although
now called Gipsies.<a name="FNanchor208" id="FNanchor208"></a><a href="#Footnote208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> He now spoke of himself and his
tribe by the name of Gipsies, without hesitation or alarm.
&#8220;Our Gipsy language,&#8221; added he, &#8220;is softer than your harsh
Gaelic.&#8221; He was at considerable pains to give me the
proper sound of the words. The letter <i>a</i> is pronounced broad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
in their language, like <i>aw</i> in paw, or <i>a</i> in water; and <i>ie</i>, or
<i>ee</i>, in the last syllable of a great many words, are sounded
short and quick; and <i>ch</i> soft, as in church. Their speech
appears to be copious, for, said he, they have a great
many words and expressions for one thing. He further
stated that the Gipsy language has no alphabet, or character,
by which it can be learned, or its grammatical construction
ascertained. He never saw any of it written. I observed
to him that it would, in course of time, be lost. He replied,
that &#8220;so long as there existed two Gipsies in Scotland, it
would never be lost.&#8221; He informed me that every one of
the Yetholm Tinklers spoke the language; and that almost
all those persons who were selling earthen-ware at St. Boswell&#8217;s
fair were Gipsies. I counted myself twenty-four families,
with earthen-ware, and nine female heads of families,
selling articles made of horn. These thirty-three families,
together with a great many single Gipsies scattered
through the fair, would amount to above three hundred Gipsies
on the spot. He further mentioned that none of the
Yetholm Gipsies were at the market. The old man also informed
me that a great number of our horse-dealers are
Gipsies. &#8220;Listen attentively,&#8221; said he, &#8220;to our horse-coupers,
in a market, and you will hear them speaking in the
Gipsy tongue.&#8221; I enquired how many there were in Scotland
acquainted with the language. He answered, &#8220;There
are several thousand.&#8221; I further enquired, if he thought the
Gipsy population would amount to five thousand souls. He
replied he was sure there were fully five thousand of his
tribe in Scotland. It was further stated to me, by this family,
that the Gipsies are at great pains in teaching their
children, from their very infancy, their own language; and
that they embrace every opportunity, when by themselves,
of conversing in it, about their ordinary affairs. They also
pride themselves very much in being in possession of a
speech peculiar to themselves&mdash;quite unknown to the public.</p>

<p>I then sent for some spirits wherewith to treat the old
chief; but I was cautioned, by one of the family, not to
press him to drink much, as, from his advanced age and infirmities,
little did him harm. The moment you speak to
an intelligent Gipsy chief, in a familiar and kindly manner,
putting yourself, as it were, on a level with him, you find
him entirely free from all embarrassment in his manners.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
He speaks to you, at once, in a free, independent, confident,
emphatic tone, without any rudeness in his way of addressing
you. He never loses his self-possession. The old chieftain
sang part of a Gipsy song, in his own language, but he
would not allow me to write it down.<a name="FNanchor209" id="FNanchor209"></a><a href="#Footnote209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Indeed, by his manner,
he seemed frequently to hesitate whether he would proceed
any further in giving me information, and appeared to
regret that he had gone so far as he had done. I now
and then stopped him in his song, and asked him the meaning
of some of the expressions. It was, however, intermixed
with a few English words; perhaps every fifth word was
English. The Gipsy words, <i>graunzie</i> (barn), <i>caunies</i> (chickens),
<i>molzie</i> (wine), <i>staurdie</i> (prison), <i>mort</i> and <i>chauvies</i>
(wife and children), were often repeated. In short, the subject
of the song was that of a Gipsy, lying in chains in
prison, lamenting that he could not support his wife and
children by plunder and robbery. The Gipsy was represented
as mourning over his hard fate, deprived of his liberty,
confined in a dungeon, and expressing the happiness and delight
which he had when free, and would have were he lying
in a barn, or out-house, living upon poultry, and drinking
wine with his tribe.<a name="FNanchor210" id="FNanchor210"></a><a href="#Footnote210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>This family, like all their race, now became much alarmed
at their communications; and it required considerable trouble
on my part to allay their fears. The old man was in
the greatest anguish of mind, at having committed himself
at all, relative to his speech. I was very sorry for his distress,
and renewed my promise not to publish his name, or
place of residence, assuring him he had nothing to fear. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
is now many years since he died. He was considered a very
decent, honest man, and was a great favourite with those
who were acquainted with him. But his wife, and some
other members of his family, followed the practices of their
ancestors.</p>

<p>Publish their language! Give to the world that which
they had kept to themselves, with so much solicitude, so
much tenacity, so much fidelity, for three hundred and fifty
years! A parallel to such a phenomenon cannot be found
within the whole range of history.<a name="FNanchor211" id="FNanchor211"></a><a href="#Footnote211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> What will the Tinklers,
the &#8220;poor things,&#8221; as Sir Walter Scott so feelingly called
them&mdash;what will they think of me, after the publication of
the present work?<a name="FNanchor212" id="FNanchor212"></a><a href="#Footnote212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>While walking one day, with a friend, around the harbour
of Grangemouth, I observed a man, who appeared above
seventy years of age, carrying a small wooden box on his
shoulder, a leathern apron tied around his waist, with a
whitish coloured bull-dog following him. He was enquiring
of the crews of the vessels in the port, whether they had
any pots, kettles, or pans to repair. Just as my friend and
I came up to him, on the quay, I said to him, in a familiar
manner, as if I knew exactly what he was, &#8220;<i>Baurie jucal</i>,&#8221;
words which signify, in the Gipsy language, a &#8220;good dog.&#8221;
Being completely taken by surprise, the old man turned
quickly round, and, looking down at his dog, said, without
thinking what he was about, &#8220;Yes, the dog is not bad.&#8221;
But the words had scarcely escaped his lips ere he affected
not to comprehend my question, after he had distinctly answered
it. He looked exceedingly foolish, and afforded my
friend a hearty laugh, at his attempt at recovering himself.
He became agitated and angry, and called out, &#8220;What do
you mean? I don&#8217;t understand you&mdash;yes, the dog is <i>hairy</i>.&#8221;
I said not another word, nor took any further notice of him,
but passed on, in case of provoking him to mischief. He
stood stock-still upon the spot, and, keeping his eyes fixed
upon me, as long as I was in sight, appeared to be considering
with himself what I could be, or whether he might not
have seen me before. He looked so surprised and alarmed,
that he could scarcely trust himself in the place, since he
found, to a certainty, that his grand secret was known. I
saw him a short while afterwards, at a little distance, with
his glasses on, sitting on the ground, in the manner of the
East, with his hammers and files, tin and copper, about him,
repairing cooking utensils belonging to a vessel in the basin;
with his trusty <i>jucal</i>, sitting close at his back, like a sentinel,
to defend him. The truth is, I was not very fond of
having anything further to do with this member of the tribe,
in case he had resented my interference with him and his
speech. This old man wore a long great-coat, and externally
looked exactly like a blacksmith. No one of ordinary
observation could have perceived him to be a Gipsy; as
there were no striking peculiarities of expression about his
countenance, which indicated him as being one of that race.
I was surprised at my own discovery.</p>

<p>A Gipsy informed me that almost all our thimble-riggers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
or &#8220;thimble-men,&#8221; as they are sometimes called, are a superior
class of Gipsies, and converse in the Gipsy language.
In the summer of 1836, an opportunity presented itself to
me to verify the truth of this information. On a by-road,
between Edinburgh and Newhaven, I fell in with a band of
these thimble-riggers, employed at their nefarious occupation.
The band consisted of six individuals, all personating
different characters of the community. Some had the appearance
of mercantile clerks, and others represented young
farmers, or dealers in cattle, of inferior appearance. The
man in charge of the board and thimbles looked like a
journeyman blacksmith or plumber. They all pretended to
be strangers to each other. Some were betting and playing,
and others looking on, and acting as decoys. None besides
themselves were present, except myself, a young lad, and a
respectable-looking elderly female. I stood and looked at
the band for a little; but as nobody was playing but themselves,
the man with the thimbles, to lead me on, urged me
to bet with him, and try my fortune at his board. I said I
did not intend to play, and was only looking at them. I
took a steady look at the faces of each of the six villains;
but, whenever their eyes caught mine, they looked away, or
down to the ground, verifying the saying that a rogue cannot
look you in the face. The man at the board again
urged me to play, and, with much vapouring and insolence,
took out a handful of notes, and said he had many hundreds
a year; that I was a poor, shabby fellow, and had no money
on me, and, therefore, could not bet with him. I desired
him to let me alone, otherwise I would let them see I was
not to be insulted, and that I knew more about them than
they were aware of. &#8220;Who the devil are you, sir, to speak
to us in that manner,&#8221; was the answer I received. I again
replied, that, if they continued their insolence, I would
show them who I was. This only provoked them the more,
and encreased their violent behaviour. High words then
arose, and the female alluded to, thinking I was in danger,
kindly entreated me to leave them. I now thought it time
to try what effect my Gipsy words would produce upon
them. In an authoritative tone of voice, I called out to
them, &#8220;<i>Chee, chee!</i>&#8221; which, in the Scottish Gipsy language,
signifies &#8220;Hold your tongue,&#8221; &#8220;be silent,&#8221; or &#8220;silence.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span><a name="FNanchor213" id="FNanchor213"></a><a href="#Footnote213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>
The surprised thimble-men were instantly silent. They
spoke not a word, but looked at one another. Only, one
of them whispered to his companions, &#8220;He is not to be
meddled with.&#8221; They immediately took up their board,
thimbles and all, and left the place, apparently in considerable
alarm, some taking one direction and some another.
The female in question was also surprised at seeing their
insolent conduct repressed, in a moment, by a single expression.
&#8220;But, sir,&#8221; said she, &#8220;what was that you said to
them, for they seem afraid?&#8221; I was myself afraid to say
another word to them, and took care they did not see me
go to my dwelling-house.<a name="FNanchor214" id="FNanchor214"></a><a href="#Footnote214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>One of the favourite, and permanent, fields of operation of
these thimblers is on the Queensferry road, from where it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
intersected by the street leading from the back of Leith
Fort, on the east, to the new road leading from Granton
pier, on the west. This part of the Queensferry road is
intersected by about half-a-dozen cross-roads, all leading
from the landing and shipping places at the piers of
Granton, Trinity, and Newhaven. These cross-roads are
cut by three roads running nearly parallel to each other,
viz., the road along the sea-beach, Trinity road, and the
Queensferry road. A great portion of the passengers, by
the many steamboats, pass along all these different roads,
to and from Edinburgh. On all of these roads, between the
water of Leith and the Forth, the thimble-riggers station
themselves, as single individuals, or in numbers, as it may
answer their purpose. In fact, this part of the country
between the sea and Edinburgh, is so much chequered by
roads crossing each other, that it may be compared to the
meshes of a spider&#8217;s web, and the thimblers as so many
spiders, watching to pounce upon their prey. The moment
one of these sentinels observes a stranger appear, signals are
made to his confederates, when their organized plan of
operations for entrapping the unwary person is immediately
put in execution. Strangers, unacquainted with the
locality, are greatly bewildered among all the cross-roads
mentioned, and have considerable difficulty in threading
their way to the city. One of the gang will then step forward,
and, pretending to be a stranger himself, will enquire
of the others the road to such and such a place. Frequently
the unsuspecting and bewildered individual will enquire of
the thimbler for some street or place in Edinburgh. The
decoy and the victim now walk in company, and converse
familiarly together on various topics; the thimbler offers
snuff to his friend, and makes himself as agreeable as he
can; while one of the gang, at a distance in front, drops a
watch, chain, or other piece of mock jewelry, or commences
playing at the thimble-board. The decoy is sure to lead
his dupe exactly to the spot where the trap is laid, and
where he will probably be plundered. One or these entrapments
terminated in the death of its subject. A working
man, having risked his half-year&#8217;s wages at the thimble-board,
of course lost every farthing of the money; and took
the loss so much to heart as, in a fit of despondency, to
drown himself in the water of Leith.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>In the beginning of 1842, I fell in with six of these thimble-riggers
and chain-droppers, on Newhaven road, on their
way to Edinburgh. I was anxious to discover the nature
of their conversation, and kept as close to them as I could,
without exciting their suspicions. Like that of most people
brought up in one particular line of life, their conversation
related wholly to their own trade&mdash;that of swindling, theft,
and robbery. I overheard them speaking of &#8220;bloody swells,&#8221;
and of dividing their booty. One of them was desired by
the others to look after a certain steamboat, expected to
arrive, and to get a bill to ascertain its movements exactly.
He said he would &#8220;require three men to take care of that
boat&#8221;; meaning, as I understood him, that all these men
were necessary for laying his snares, and executing his
designs upon the unsuspecting passengers, as they landed
from the vessel, and were on their way to their destinations.
The manager of the steamboat company could not have
consulted with his subordinates, about their lawful affairs,
with more care and deliberation, or in a more cool, business-like
way, than were these villains in contriving plans for
plundering the public. On their approach to Pilrig street, the
band separated into pairs; some taking the north, and some
the south, side of Leith walk, for Edinburgh, where they
vanished in the crowd. Their language was fearful, every
expression being accompanied by a terrible oath.</p>

<p>On another occasion, I fell in with another band of these
vagabond thimble-men, on the Dalkeith road, near Craigmiller
Castle. I asked the fellow with the thimbles, &#8220;Is
that <i>gaugie a nawken</i>?&#8221; pointing to one of the gang who
had just left him. The question, in plain English, was, &#8220;Is
that man a Gipsy?&#8221; The thimbler flew at once into a great
passion, and bawled out, &#8220;Ask himself, sir.&#8221; He then fell
upon me, and a gentleman who was with me, in most abusive
language, applying to us the most insulting epithets he could
think of. It was evident to my friend that the thimble-man
perfectly understood my Gipsy question. So enraged was
he, that we were afraid he would follow us, and do us some
harm. My friend did not consider himself safe till he was
in the middle of Edinburgh, for many a look did he cast behind
him, to see whether the Gipsy was not in pursuit of us.<a name="FNanchor215" id="FNanchor215"></a><a href="#Footnote215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>The Gipsies in Scotland consider themselves to be of the
same stock as those in England and Ireland, for they are all
acquainted with the same speech. They afford assistance to
one another, whenever they happen to meet. The following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
facts will at least show that the Scottish and Irish Gipsies
are one and the same people.</p>

<p>In the county of Fife, I once fell in with an Irish
family, to appearance in great poverty and distress, resting
themselves on the side of the public road. A shelty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
and an ass were grazing hard by. The ass they used in
carrying a woman, who, they said, was a hundred and one
years of age. She was shrunk and withered to a skeleton,
or rather, I should say, to a bundle of bones; and her chin
almost rested on her knees, and her body was nearly doubled
by age. On interrogating the head of the family, I found
that his name was Hugh White, and that he was an Irishman,
and a son of the old woman who was with him. I put
some Gipsy words to him, to ascertain whether or not he
was one of the tribe. He pretended not to understand what
I said; but his daughter, of about six years of age, replied,
&#8220;But I understand what he says.&#8221; I then called out
sharply to him, &#8220;<i>Jaw vree</i>&#8220;&mdash;(&#8220;Go away,&#8221; or &#8220;get out of
the way.&#8221;) &#8220;As soon as I can,&#8221; was his answer. On
leaving him, I again called, &#8220;<i>Beenship-davies</i>&#8220;&mdash;(&#8220;Good-day.&#8221;)
&#8220;Good-day, sir; God bless you,&#8221; was his immediate
reply.</p>

<p>I happened, at another time, to be in the court-house of
one of the burghs north of the Forth, when two Irishmen,
of the names of O&#8217;Reilly and McEwan, were at the bar for
having been found drunk, and fighting within the town.
They were sentenced by the magistrates to three days&#8217; imprisonment,
and to be &#8220;banished the town,&#8221; for their riotous
conduct. The men had the Irish accent, and had certainly
been born and brought up in Ireland; but their habiliments
and general appearance did not correspond exactly with the
ordinary dress and manners of common Irish peasants, although
their features were in all respects Hibernian. When
the magistrates questioned them in respect to their conduct,
the prisoners looked very grave, and said, &#8220;Sure, and it
plase your honours, our quarrel was nothing but whiskey,
and sure we are the best friends in the world;&#8221; and seemed
very penitent. But when the magistrates were not looking
at them, they were smiling to each other, and keeping up a
communication in pantomime. Suspecting them to be Irish
Gipsies, I addressed the wife of McEwan as follows: &#8220;For
what is the <i>riah</i> (magistrate) going to put your <i>gaugie</i>
(man) in <i>staurdie</i>, (prison)?&#8221; &#8220;Only for a little whiskey,
sir,&#8221; was her immediate reply. She gave me, on the spot,
the English of the following words; adding, at the same
time, that I had got the <i>Gipsy</i> language, but that hers was
only the <i>English cant</i>. She was afraid to acknowledge that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
she was a Gipsy, as such a confession might, in her opinion,
have proved prejudicial to her husband, in the situation in
which he was placed.</p>

<ul class="words">
<li><i>Gaugie</i>, man.</li>
<li><i>Managie</i>, woman.</li>
<li><i>Chauvies</i>, children.</li>
<li><i>Riah</i>, magistrate.</li>
<li><i>Chor</i>, thief.</li>
<li><i>Yaka</i>, eyes.</li>
<li><i>Grye</i>, horse.</li>
<li><i>Roys</i>, spoons.</li>
<li><i>Skews</i>, platters.</li>
<li><i>Mashlam</i>, metal.</li>
</ul>

<p>I observed the woman instantly communicate to her husband
the conversation she had with me. She immediately
returned to me, and, after questioning me as to my name,
occupation, and place of residence, very earnestly entreated
me to save her <i>gaugie</i> from the <i>staurdie</i>. I asked her, how
many <i>chauvies</i> she had? &#8220;Twelve, sir.&#8221; Were any of
them <i>chors</i>? &#8220;None, sir.&#8221; Two of her <i>chauvies</i> were in
her hand, weeping bitterly. The woman was in great distress,
and when she heard the sound of her own language,
she thought she saw a friend. I informed one of the magistrates,
whom I knew, that the prisoners were Gipsies; and
proposed to him to mitigate the punishment of the woman&#8217;s
husband, on condition of his giving me a specimen of his
secret speech. But the reply of the man of authority was,
&#8220;The scoundrel shall lie in prison till the last hour of his
sentence.&#8221; The &#8220;scoundrel&#8221; however, did not remain in durance
so long. While the jailer was securing him in prison,
the determined Tinkler, with the utmost coolness and indifference,
asked him, which part of the jail would be the easiest
for him to break through. The jailer told him that, if he
attempted to escape, the watchman, stationed in the church-yard,
close to the prison, would shoot him. On visiting the
prison next morning, the turnkey found that the Gipsy had
undone the locks of the doors, and fled during the night.
O&#8217;Reilly, the other Gipsy, remained, in a separate cell, the
whole period of his sentence. When the officers were completing
the other part of his punishment&mdash;&#8220;banishing him
from the town&#8221;&mdash;the regardless, light-hearted Irish Tinkler
went capering along the streets, with his coat off, brandishing,
and sweeping, and twirling his shillalah, in the Gipsy
fashion. Meeting, in this excited state, his late judge, the
Tinkler, with the utmost contempt and derision, called out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
to him, &#8220;Plase your honour! won&#8217;t you now take a fight
with me, for the sake of friendship?&#8221; This worthy Irish
Gipsy represented himself as the head Tinkler in Perth, and
the first of the second class of boxers.</p>

<p>On another occasion, I observed a horde of Gipsies on
the high street of Inverkeithing, employed in making spoons
from horn. I spoke to one of the young married men, partly
in Scottish Gipsy words, when he immediately answered me
in English. He said they were all natives of Ireland. They
had, male and female, the Irish accent completely. I invited
this man to accompany me to a public-house, that I might
obtain from him a specimen of his Irish Gipsy language.
The town-clerk being in my company at the time, I asked
him to go with me, to hear what passed; but he refused,
evidently because he considered that the company of a
Gipsy would contaminate and degrade him. I treated the
Tinkler with a glass of spirits, and obtained from him the
following words:</p>

<ul class="words">
<li><i>Yaik</i>, one.</li>
<li><i>Duie</i>, two.</li>
<li><i>Trin</i>, three.</li>
<li><i>Punch</i>, five.</li>
<li><i>Saus</i>, six.</li>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>This man conducted himself very politely, his behaviour being
very correct and becoming; and he seemed much pleased
at being noticed, and kindly treated. At first, he spoke
wholly in the Gipsy language, thinking that I was as well
acquainted with it as himself. But when he found that I
knew only a few words of it, he, like all his tribe, stopped
in his communications, and, in this instance, began to quiz
and laugh at my ignorance. On returning to the street, I
repeated some of the words to one of the females. She
laughed, and, with much good humour, said, &#8220;You will put
me out, by speaking to me in that language.&#8221;</p>

<p>These facts prove that the Irish Gipsies have the same
language as those in Scotland. The English Gipsy is substantially
the same. There are a great many Irish Gipsies
travelling in Scotland, of whom I will again speak, in the
<a href="#Page_341">following chapter</a>. They are not easily distinguished
from common Irish peasants, except that they are generally
employed in some sort of traffic, such as hawking
earthen-ware, trinkets, and various other trifles, through the
country.</p>

<p>It may interest the reader to know how the idea originated
that the Gipsies, at all events their speech, came, or
was thought to have come, from Hindostan. According to
Grellmann, it was in this way:</p>

<p>&#8220;The following is an article to be found in the Vienna
Gazette, from a Captain Szekely, who was thinking of
searching for (the origin of) the Gipsies, and their language,
in the East Indies: In the year 1763, on the 6th of November,
a printer, whose name was Stephen Pap Szathmar Nemethi,
came to see me. Talking upon various subjects, we
at last fell upon that of the Gipsies; and my guest related
to me the following anecdote, from the mouth of a preacher
of the Reformed Church, Stephen Vali, at Almasch. When
the said Vali studied at the University of Leyden, he was
intimately acquainted with some young Malabars, of whom
three are obliged constantly to study there; nor can they return
home till relieved by three others. Having observed that
their native language bore a great affinity to that spoken
by the Gipsies, he availed himself of the opportunity to note
down from themselves upwards of one thousand words, together
with their significations. After Vali was returned
from the University, he informed himself of the Raber Gipsies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
concerning the meaning of his Malabar words, which
they explained without trouble or hesitation.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor216" id="FNanchor216"></a><a href="#Footnote216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>None of the Scottish Gipsy words have as yet, I believe,
been collated with the Hindostanee, the supposed mother
tongue of the Gipsies.<a name="FNanchor217" id="FNanchor217"></a><a href="#Footnote217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> I showed my list to a gentleman
lately from India, who, at first sight, pointed out, from
among several hundred words and sentences scattered
through these pages, about thirty-nine which very closely resembled
Hindostanee. But in ascertaining the origin of the
Gipsies, the traveller, Dr. Bright, thinks it would be desirable
to procure some of the speech of the lowest classes in
India, and compare it with the Gipsy, as spoken in Europe;
for the purpose of showing, more correctly, the affinity of
the two languages. He supposes, as I understand him, that
the terms used by the despised and unlettered Gipsies
would probably resemble more closely the vulgar idiom of
the lowest castes in India, than the Hindostanee spoken by
the higher ranks, or that which is to be found in books.
The following facts show that Dr. Bright&#8217;s conjectures are
not far from the truth.</p>

<p>I had occasion at one time to be on board of a vessel
lying in the harbour of Limekilns, Fifeshire, where I observed
a black man, acting as cook, of the name of John
Lobbs, about twenty-five years of age, and a native of Bombay,
who could neither read nor write any language whatever.
He stated that he was now a Christian, and had
been baptized by the name of John. He had been absent
from India three years, as cabin boy, in several British vessels,
and spoke English well. He appeared to be of a low
caste in his native land, but sharpened by his contact with
Europeans. Recollecting Dr. Bright&#8217;s hint, it occurred to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
me that this Hindoo&#8217;s vulgar dialect might resemble the
language of our Scottish Gipsies. I repeated to him about
one hundred and eighty Gipsy words and expressions. The
greater part were familiar to his ear, but many of them
that meant one thing in Gipsy, had quite a different signification
in his speech. I shall, however, give the following
Gipsy words, with the corresponding words of Lobb&#8217;s language,
and the English opposite.<a name="FNanchor218" id="FNanchor218"></a><a href="#Footnote218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>My informant understood, he said, two of the dialects of
Hindostan, the one called the Hindoo, and the other the
Moors&#8217; language. The former, he said, the English in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
India generally spoke, but understood little of the latter;
and that he himself did not know a word of the language
of the Brahmins. When he failed to produce, in the Moors&#8217;
language, the word corresponding to the Gipsy one, he frequently
found it in what he called the Hindoo speech. The
greater part of the Gipsy words, as I have already mentioned,
were familiar to his ear; but many of them that
signified one thing in his speech, meant quite another in
Gipsy. For example, the word <i>Graunagie</i>, in Gipsy, signifies
a <i>barn</i>; with Lobbs, it meant an <i>old rich man</i>. <i>Coories</i>,
bed clothes or blankets, signified, in Lobbs&#8217; dialect, <i>ornaments
for the ears</i>. <i>Dill</i>, a servant maid, according to Lobbs,
was a <i>church</i>. <i>Shan davies</i>, a bad day, was the Hindostanee
for <i>holiday</i>. <i>Managie</i>, a woman, signifies the <i>name
of a person</i>, such as John or James. <i>Chavo</i>, a son, meant
a <i>female child</i>; and <i>Pooklie</i>, hulled barley, <i>anything
fine</i>. The two Gipsy words <i>Callo</i> and <i>Rat</i> are black and
night; but, according to Lobbs, <i>Callorat</i> is simply anything
dark.<a name="FNanchor220" id="FNanchor220"></a><a href="#Footnote220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>To confirm my collection of Scottish Gipsy words, I will
collate some of those which I sent to Sir Walter Scott, for
examination but not for publication, with those to be found
in Mr. Baird&#8217;s report, a publication which I first saw in
1842.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>That the Gipsy language, in Scotland, is intermixed with
cant, or slang, and other words, is certain, as will appear by the
specimens I have exhibited.<a name="FNanchor222" id="FNanchor222"></a><a href="#Footnote222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> I am inclined to believe, however,
that were the cant and slang used by our flash men and
others carefully examined, much of it would turn out to be
corrupted Hindostanee, picked up from the Gipsies. I have,
after considerable trouble, produced, and, I may venture to
say, faithfully recorded, the raw materials as I found them:
to separate the other words from the original and genuine
Gipsy, is a task I leave to the learned philologist. I shall
only observe, that the way in which the Gipsy language has
been corrupted is this: That whenever the Gipsies find
words not understood by the people among whom they
travel, they commit such to memory, and use them in their
conversation, for the purpose of concealment. In the Lowlands
of Scotland, for example, they make use of Gaelic,<a name="FNanchor223" id="FNanchor223"></a><a href="#Footnote223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Welsh,
Irish, and French words. These picked-up words and terms
have, in the end, become part of their own peculiar tongue;
yet some of the Gipsies are able to point out a number of
these foreign words, as distinguished from their own. In
this manner do the Gipsies carry along with them part of
the language of every country through which they pass.<a name="FNanchor224" id="FNanchor224"></a><a href="#Footnote224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>In concluding my account of the Scottish Gipsy language,
I may observe, that I think few who have perused my details
will hesitate for a moment in pronouncing that the
people have migrated from Hindostan. Many convincing
proofs of the origin of the race have been adduced by Grellmann,
Hoyland, and Bright; and I think that my researches,
made in Scotland alone, have confirmed the statements of
these respectable authors.</p>

<p>The question which now remains to be solved is this:
From what tribe or nation at present in, or originally from,
Hindostan are the Gipsies descended? That they have
been a robber or predatory nation, from principle as well
as practice, I am convinced little doubt can be entertained.
Even yet, the greater the art and address displayed in committing
a dexterous theft or robbery, the higher is the merit
of such an action esteemed among their fraternity. I am
also convinced that this general, or national, propensity to
plunder has been the chief cause of the Gipsies concealing
their origin, language, customs, and religious observances,
at the time they entered the territories of civilized nations,
and up to this time. The intelligent old Gipsy, whose acquaintance
I made at St. Boswell&#8217;s, distinctly told me, that
his tribe were originally a nation of thieves and robbers;
and it is quite natural to suppose that, when they found
theft and robbery punished with such severity, in civilized
society, everything relating to them would be kept a profound
secret.</p>

<p>The tribe in India whose customs, manners, and habits
have the greatest resemblance to those of the Gipsies, are
the <i>Nuts</i>, or <i>Bazegurs</i>; an account of which is to be found
in the 7th volume of the Asiatic Researches, page 451. In
Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine we find the following paragraph relative
to these Nuts, or Bazegurs, which induces a belief that
these people are a branch of the Gipsy nation, and a tribe
of the highest antiquity. They are even supposed to be the
wild, aboriginal inhabitants of India.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>&#8220;A lady of rank, who has resided some time in India,
lately informed me that the Gipsies are to be found there,
in the same way as in England, and practise the same arts of
posture-making and tumbling, fortune-telling, stealing, and
so forth. The Indian Gipsies are called Nuts, or Bazegurs,
and they are believed by many to be the remains of an
aboriginal race, prior even to the Hindoos, and who have
never adopted the worship of Bramah. They are entirely
different from the Parias, who are Hindoos that have lost
caste, and so become degraded.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Nuts, or Bazegurs, under the name of Decoits or
Dukyts, are, it seems, guilty of frequently sacrificing victims
to the goddess Calie, under circumstances of horror and
atrocity scarcely credible. Now the old Gipsy, who gave
me the particulars relative to the Gipsy sacrifice of the
horse, stated that sometimes both woman and horse were
sacrificed, when the woman, by the action of the horse, was
found to have greatly offended.</p>

<p>In the ordinances of Menu, the Nuts, or Bazegurs, are called
<i>Nata</i>. Now, our Scottish Gipsies, at this moment, call
themselves <i>Nawkens</i>, a word not very dissimilar in sound to
<i>Nata</i>. When I have spoken to them, in their own words,
I have been asked, &#8220;Are you a <i>nawken</i>?&#8221; a word to which
they attach the meaning of a <i>wanderer</i>, or <i>traveller</i>&mdash;one
who can do any sort of work for himself that may be required
in the world.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote189" id="Footnote189"></a><a href="#FNanchor189"><span class="label">[189]</span></a> Before considering this trait in the character of the Scottish Gipsies,
it may interest the reader to know that the same peculiarity obtains among
those on the continent.</p>

<p>Of the Hungarian Gipsies, Grellmann writes: &#8220;It will be recollected, from
the first, how great a secret they make of their language, and how suspicious
they appear when any person wishes to learn a few words of it.
Even if the Gipsy is not perverse, he is very inattentive, and is consequently
likely to answer some other rather than the true Gipsy word.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of the Hungarian Gipsies, Bright says: &#8220;No one, who has not had experience,
can conceive the difficulty of gaining intelligible information, from
people so rude, upon the subject of their language. If you ask for a word,
they give you a whole sentence; and on asking a second time, they give
the sentence a totally different turn, or introduce some figure altogether
new. Thus it was with our Gipsy, who, at length, tired of our questions,
prayed most piteously to be released; which we granted him, only on condition
of his returning in the evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of the Spanish Gipsies, Mr. Borrow writes: &#8220;It is only by listening
attentively to the speech of the Gitanos, whilst discoursing among themselves,
that an acquaintance with their dialect can be formed, and by seizing
upon all unknown words, as they fall in succession from their lips. Nothing
can be more useless and hopeless than the attempt to obtain possession
of their vocabulary, by enquiring of them how particular objects and ideas
are styled in the same; for, with the exception of the names of the most
common things, they are totally incapable, as a Spanish writer has observed,
of yielding the required information; owing to their great ignorance, the
shortness of their memories, or, rather, the state of bewilderment to which
their minds are brought by any question which tends to bring their reasoning
faculties into action; though, not unfrequently, the very words which
have been in vain required of them will, a minute subsequently, proceed
inadvertently from their mouths.&#8221;</p>

<p>What has been said by the two last-named writers is very wide of the
mark; Grellmann, however, hits it exactly. The Gipsies have excellent memories.
It is all they have to depend on. If they had not good memories, how
could they, at the present day, speak a word of their language at all? The
difficulty in question is down-right shuffling, and not a want of memory on
the part of the Gipsy. The present chapter will throw some light on the
subject. Even Mr. Borrow himself gives an ample refutation to his sweeping
account of the Spanish Gipsies, in regard to their language; for, in another
part of his work, he says: &#8220;I recited the Apostles&#8217; Creed to the
Gipsies, sentence by sentence, which they translated as I proceeded. They
exhibited the greatest eagerness and interest in their unwonted occupation,
and frequently broke into loud disputes as to the best rendering, many being
offered at the same time. I then read the translation aloud, whereupon
they raised a shout of exultation, and appeared not a little proud of the
composition.&#8221; On this occasion, Mr. Borrow evidently had the Gipsies in
the right humour&mdash;that is, off their guard, excited, and much interested in
the subject. He says, in another place: &#8220;The language they speak among
themselves, and they are particularly anxious to keep others in ignorance
of it.&#8221; As a general thing, they seem to have been bored by people much
above them in the scale of society; with whom, their natural politeness,
and expectations of money or other benefits, would naturally lead them to
do anything than give them that which it is inborn in their nature to
keep to themselves.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote190" id="Footnote190"></a><a href="#FNanchor190"><span class="label">[190]</span></a> This opinion is confirmed by the fact that the Gipsies whom the Rev.
Mr. Crabbe has civilized will not now be seen among the others of the
tribe, at his annual festival, at Southampton. We have already seen, under
the head of Continental Gipsies, that &#8220;those who are gold-washers in
Transylvania and the Banat have no intercourse with others of their nation;
nor do they like to be called Gipsies.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote191" id="Footnote191"></a><a href="#FNanchor191"><span class="label">[191]</span></a> On the whole, however, our Scottish peasantry, in some districts, do
not greatly despise the Tinklers; at least not to the same extent as the
inhabitants of some other countries seem to do. When not involved in
quarrels with the Gipsies, our country people, with the exception of a considerable
portion of the land-owners, were, and are even yet, rather fond
of the <i>superior</i> families of the <i>nomadic</i> class of these people, than otherwise.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote192" id="Footnote192"></a><a href="#FNanchor192"><span class="label">[192]</span></a> Their (the female&#8217;s) speech is as fluent, and their eyes as unabashed, in
the presence of royalty, as before those from whom they have nothing to
hope or fear; the result of which is, that most minds quail before them.&mdash;<i>Borrow

<p><a name="Footnote193" id="Footnote193"></a><a href="#FNanchor193"><span class="label">[193]</span></a> This woman evidently mistook our author for a Gipsy <i>gent</i>, such as he

<p><a name="Footnote194" id="Footnote194"></a><a href="#FNanchor194"><span class="label">[194]</span></a> It would be well for the reader to consider what a <i>Gipsy is</i>, irrespective
of the <i>language which he speaks</i>; for the <i>race</i> comes <i>before</i> the <i>speech</i>
which it uses. That will be done fully in my <a href="#Page_371">Disquisition</a> on the Gipsies.
The language, considered in itself, however interesting it may be, is a secondary
consideration; it may ultimately disappear, while the people who
now speak it will remain.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote195" id="Footnote195"></a><a href="#FNanchor195"><span class="label">[195]</span></a> The Gipsies are always afraid to say what they would do in such cases.
Perhaps they don&#8217;t know, but have only a general impression that the individual
would &#8220;catch it;&#8221; or there may be some old law on the subject.
What Ruthven said of her&#8217;s being a desperate race is true enough, and
murderous too, among themselves as distinguished from the inhabitants
generally. Her remark was evidently part of that <i>frightening</i> policy which
keeps the natives from molesting the tribe. See <a href="#Page_44">page 44</a>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote196" id="Footnote196"></a><a href="#FNanchor196"><span class="label">[196]</span></a> Ponqueville, in his travels, says that the Gipsies in the Levant have

<p><a name="Footnote199" id="Footnote199"></a><a href="#FNanchor199"><span class="label">[199]</span></a> Sir Walter Scott was disposed to think that our Gipsy population was
rather exaggerated at five thousand souls; but when families such as the
above mentioned are taken into account&mdash;leaving alone those who may be
classed as settled Gipsies&mdash;I am convinced that their number is not over-estimated.</p>

<p>[Not being in possession of sufficient information on the subject of the
Gipsies, the opinion of Sir Walter Scott, on the point in question, amounted
to nothing. See the Index, for <a href="#Secref1">Sir Walter Scott&#8217;s ideas of the Scottish
Gipsy population</a>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p><a name="Footnote200" id="Footnote200"></a><a href="#FNanchor200"><span class="label">[200]</span></a> In speaking of the more original kind of Gipsy, Grellmann says: &#8220;No
Gipsy has ever signalized himself in literature, notwithstanding many of
them have partaken of the instruction to be obtained at public schools.
Their volatile disposition and unsteadiness will not allow them to complete
anything which requires perseverance or application. In the midst of his
career of learning, the recollection of his origin seizes him; he desires to
return to what he thinks a more happy manner of life; this solicitude encreases;
he gives up all at once, turns back again, and consigns over his
knowledge to oblivion.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are too many circumstances surrounding such a Gipsy to remind
him of his origin, and arrest him in his career of learning: for his race
never having been tolerated&mdash;that is, no position ever having been assigned
it, he feels as if he were a vagabond, if known or openly avowed to the
public as a member of the tribe. And this, in itself, is sufficient to discourage
such a Gipsy in every effort towards improvement.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote201" id="Footnote201"></a><a href="#FNanchor201"><span class="label">[201]</span></a> On mentioning to Sir Walter Scott, when at Abbotsford, that the Gipsies
were very partial to Hughie the Gr&aelig;me, he caused his eldest daughter,
afterwards Mrs. Lockhart, to sing this ancient Border song, which she
readily did, accompanying her voice with the harp. We were, at the time,
in the room which contained his old armour and other antiquities; to which
place he had asked me, after tea, to hear his daughter play on the harp.
She sang Hughie the Gr&aelig;me, in a plain, simple, unaffected manner, exactly
in the style in which I have heard the humble country-girls singing the
same song, in the south of Scotland. Sir Walter was much interested about
the Gipsies; and when I repeated to him a short sentence in their speech,
he, with great feeling, exclaimed, &#8220;Poor things! do you hear that?&#8221; This
was the first time, I believe, that he ever heard a Scottish Gipsy word
pronounced. It appeared to me that the mind of the great magician was
not wholly divested of the fear that the Gipsies might, in some way or
other, injure his young plantations.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote203" id="Footnote203"></a><a href="#FNanchor203"><span class="label">[203]</span></a> These sixteen farms embraced about 25,000 acres of mountainous land,
maintained 13,000 sheep, 100 goats, 250 cattle, 50 horses, 20 draught-oxen,
and 60 dogs; 29 shepherds, 26 other servants, and 15 cotters, making,
with their families, 228 souls, supported by my ancestor&#8217;s property, as that
of a Scotch gentleman-farmer. On the farms mentioned, which lay in Mid-Lothian,
Tweed-dale, and Selkirkshire, the Gipsies were allowed to remain
as long as they pleased; and no loss was ever sustained by the indulgence.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote204" id="Footnote204"></a><a href="#FNanchor204"><span class="label">[204]</span></a> I am convinced the Gipsies have a method of communicating with one
another by their hands and fingers, and it is likely this man tried me, in
that way, both at the fair and in his own house. I know a man who has
seen the Gipsies communicating their thoughts to each other in this way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bargains among the Indians are conducted in the most profound silence,
and by merely touching each other&#8217;s hands. If the seller takes the whole
hand, it implies a thousand rupees or pagodas; five fingers import five
hundred; one finger, one hundred; half a finger, fifty; a single joint only
ten. In this manner, they will often, in a crowded room, conclude the most
important transactions, without the company suspecting that anything
whatever was doing.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Historical Account of Travels in Asia, by Hugh
Murray.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Method of the English selling their cargoes, at Jedda, to the Turks</i>:
Two Indian brokers come into the room to settle the price, one on the part
of the Indian captain, the other on that of the buyer or Turk. They are
neither Mahommedans nor Christians, but have credit with both. They sit
down on the carpet, and take an Indian shawl, which they carry on their
shoulders like a napkin, and spread it over their hands. They talk, in the
meantime, indifferent conversation, of the arrival of ships from India, or of
the news of the day, as if they were employed in no serious business whatever.
After about twenty minutes spent in handling each other&#8217;s fingers,
below the shawl, the bargain is concluded, say for nine ships, without one
word ever having been spoken on the subject, or pen or ink used in any
shape whatever.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Bruce&#8217;s Travels.</i></p>

<p><a name="Footnote205" id="Footnote205"></a><a href="#FNanchor205"><span class="label">[205]</span></a> It is interesting to notice the reason for this old Gipsy chief being so
backward in giving our author some of his language. &#8220;He was ashamed
to do it.&#8221; Pity it is that there should be a man in Scotland, who, independent
of personal character, should be ashamed of such a thing. Then, see
how the Gipsy woman, in our author&#8217;s house, said that &#8220;the public would
look upon her with horror and contempt, were it known she could speak the
Gipsy language.&#8221; And again, the two female Gipsies, who would rather
allow themselves to be murdered, than give the meaning of two Gipsy
words to Sauchie colliers, for the reason that &#8220;it would have exposed their
tribe, and made themselves odious to the world.&#8221; And all for knowing the
Gipsy language!&mdash;which would be considered an accomplishment in another
person! What frightful tyranny! Mr. Borrow, as we will by and
by see, says a great deal about the law of Charles III, in regard to the prospects
of the Spanish Gipsies. But there is a law above any legislative
enactment&mdash;the law of society, of one&#8217;s fellow-creatures&mdash;which bears so
hard upon the Gipsies; the despotism of caste. If Gipsies, in such humble
circumstances, are so afraid of being known to be Gipsies, we can form some
idea of the morbid sensitiveness of those in a higher sphere of life.</p>

<p>The innkeeper evidently thought himself in bad company, when our author
asked him for the Tinkler&#8217;s house, or that any intercourse with a Tinkler
would contaminate and degrade him. In this light, read an anecdote
in the history of John Bunyan, who was one of the same people, as I shall
afterwards show. In applying for his release from Bedford jail, his wife
said to Justice Hale, &#8220;Moreover, my lord, I have four small children that
cannot help themselves, of which one is blind, and we have nothing to live
upon but the charity of good people.&#8221; Thereat, Justice Hale, looking very
soberly on the matter, said, &#8220;Alas, poor woman!&#8221; &#8220;What is his calling?&#8221;
continued the judge. And some of the company, that stood by, said, (evidently
in interruption, and with a bitter sneer,) &#8220;A Tinker, my lord!&#8221;
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Bunyan&#8217;s wife, &#8220;and because he is a Tinker, and a poor
man, therefore he is despised, and cannot have justice.&#8221; Noble woman!
wife of a noble Gipsy! If the world wishes to know who John Bunyan
really was, it can find him depicted in our author&#8217;s visit to this Scottish
Gipsy family, where it can also learn the meaning of Bunyan, at a time
when Jews were legally excluded from England, taking so much trouble to
ascertain whether he was of that race, or not. From the present work
generally, the world can learn the reason why Bunyan said nothing of his
ancestry and nationality, when giving an account of his own history.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote206" id="Footnote206"></a><a href="#FNanchor206"><span class="label">[206]</span></a> <i>Sallah</i>, in the Scottish Gipsy speech, properly signifies accursed, or detested.
It is one of the most abusive expressions that can be used towards
your fellow creatures. Nothing terrifies a young Gipsy so much as to bawl
out to him, &#8220;<i>Sallah, jaw drom</i>,&#8221; which, in plain English, nearly means,
&#8220;You accursed, take the road.&#8221;</p>

<p>It appears that, in Hindostanee, <i>Salla</i> is a word of the highest reproach,
and that nothing can provoke a Hindoo so much as the applying of it to
him. When cursing and swearing, by what would appear to be the Deity,
the Gipsies make use of the word <i>Sallahen</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote207" id="Footnote207"></a><a href="#FNanchor207"><span class="label">[207]</span></a> <i>Nawken</i> has a number of significations, such as Tinkler, Gipsy, a wanderer,
a worker in iron, a man who can do anything for himself in the
mechanical arts, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote208" id="Footnote208"></a><a href="#FNanchor208"><span class="label">[208]</span></a> The tradition among the Scottish Gipsies of being Ethiopians, whatever
weight the reader may attach to it, dates as far back, at least, as the
year 1615; for it is mentioned in the remission under the privy seal,
granted to William Auchterlony, of Cayrine, for resetting John Faa and
his followers. <i>See <a href="#Page_113">page 113</a>.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote209" id="Footnote209"></a><a href="#FNanchor209"><span class="label">[209]</span></a> The Scottish Gipsies have doubtless an oral literature, like their brethren
in other countries. It would be strange indeed if they did not rank as
high, in that respect, as many of the barbarous tribes in the world. People
so situated, with no written language, are wonderfully apt at picking up,
and retaining, any composition that contains poetry and music, to which
oral literature is chiefly confined. In that respect, their faculties, like those
of the blind, are sharpened by the wants which others do not experience in
indulging a feeling common to all mankind.</p>

<p>A striking instance of a people, unacquainted with the art of writing,
possessing a literature, is said to have been found in Hawaii; and to such
an extent, as to &#8220;possess a force and compass that, at the beginning of the
study of it, would not have been credited.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote210" id="Footnote210"></a><a href="#FNanchor210"><span class="label">[210]</span></a> A song which a female Gipsy sang to Mr. Borrow, at Moscow, commenced
in this way, &#8220;Her head is aching with grief, as if she had tasted
wine;&#8221; and ended thus, &#8220;That she may depart in quest of the lord of her
bosom, and share his joys and pleasures.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote211" id="Footnote211"></a><a href="#FNanchor211"><span class="label">[211]</span></a> Smith, in his &#8220;Hebrew people,&#8221; writes: &#8220;The Jews had almost lost, in
the <i>seventy</i> years&#8217; captivity, their original language; that was now become
dead; and they spoke a jargon made up of their own language and that of
the Chaldeans, and other nations with whom they had mingled. Formerly,
preachers had only explained subjects; now, they were obliged to explain
words; words which, in the sacred code, were become obsolete, equivocal,
dead.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote212" id="Footnote212"></a><a href="#FNanchor212"><span class="label">[212]</span></a> The Gipsies have been much annoyed, in late times, by people anxious
to find out their secrets. The circumstance caused them, at first, much
alarm as to what it meant; but when they came to learn the object of this
modern Gipsy-hunting, they became, in a measure, reconciled to their troubles;
for they were perfectly satisfied that the labours of these inquisitive
people would, in the language of Ruthven, &#8220;be in vain.&#8221; But the attempt
of our author, with his &#8220;open sesame,&#8221; caused not a few of them to travel
through life with the weight of a millstone hanging about their necks,
which the publication, now, is perhaps calculated to lighten. The &#8220;giving
to the world everything relative to their tribe,&#8221; was something they were
more apt to over than under estimate. To be &#8220;put in the papers,&#8221; judging
from the horror with which such is regarded by our own humble people,
was bad enough; still, the end of that would, in their peculiar way of
thinking, be merely the &#8220;lighting of the candles, and curling the hair, of
the gentle folk.&#8221; But to have themselves put in a book&mdash;to see themselves,
in their imaginations, &#8220;carried about in every bit herd-laddie&#8217;s pouch,&#8221; was
something that aggravated them. The presumptuous pride, the overweening
conceit of a high-mettled Scottish Gipsy; his boasted descent&mdash;a descent
at once high, illustrious, and lost in antiquity; his unbounded contempt
for the rabble of town and country&mdash;rendered him, under the circumstances,
almost incapable of brooking the idea of seeing his race
exposed to, what he would consider, the ridicule of the very herds. The
very idea of it was to him mortifying and maddening. Well might our
author, from having been so much mixed up with the Gipsies, show some
hesitancy ere taking a step that would have brought such a nest of hornets
about his ears. But, all things considered, my impression is, that the outdoor
Gipsies, at the present day, will feel extremely proud of the present
work; and that the same may be said of all classes of them, if one subject
had been excluded from the volume, over which they will be very apt to
growl a little in secret.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote213" id="Footnote213"></a><a href="#FNanchor213"><span class="label">[213]</span></a> A lady, who had been seventeen years in India, told me that &#8220;<i>Chee</i>,
<i>chee</i>&#8221; was, in Hindostanee, an expression of reproof, corresponding exactly
with our &#8220;Fie, shame!&#8221; &#8220;Oh fie, shame!&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote214" id="Footnote214"></a><a href="#FNanchor214"><span class="label">[214]</span></a> About four years after this occurrence, I was invited to dine at the
house of a friend, with whose wife I was not acquainted. On being introduced
to her, I was rather surprised at the repeated hard looks which she took at
me. At last she said, &#8220;I think I have seen you before. Were you never
engaged with a band of thimble-men, near Newhaven?&#8221; I said I was,
some years ago. &#8220;Do you recollect,&#8221; continued she, &#8220;of a female taking
you by the arm, and urging you to leave them?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Perfectly.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, then, I am the female; and I yet recollect your words were <i>Chee,
chee</i>.&#8221; She mentioned the circumstance to her husband at the time; but he
always said to her that I must have been only one of the blackguards
themselves, deceiving her. He would not listen to her when she described
me as not at all like a thimble-rigger, but always answered her, &#8220;I tell ye,
woman, the man you spoke to was nothing but one of these villains.&#8221;</p>

<p>The thimble-riggers who molested Mr. Rose, ship-builder, so much, also
answered my Gipsy words distinctly; and, ever afterwards, took off their
hats to me, as I passed them playing at their game.</p>

<p>[The thimble-men here alluded to took up their quarters immediately to
the west of Leith Fort, where the road takes a turn, at a right angle, a
little in front of Mr. Rose&#8217;s house, and there takes a similar turn towards
the west: the best position for carrying on the thimble game. So exasperated
was this gentleman, when, by every means in his power, he failed
to dislodge them, that he sent some of the men from his yard, to erect, on
the spot, a pole, which he covered with sheet-iron, to prevent its being cut
down; and placed on the top of it a board, having this upon it, &#8220;Beware
of thimble-riggers and chain-droppers,&#8221; with a hand pointing directly
below. This had no effect, however, for the &#8220;knights of the thimble&#8221; pursued
their game right under it. A gentleman, in passing one day, directed
their attention to the board, but the only reply he got was, &#8220;Bah! that&#8217;s
nothing. Where can you find a shop without a sign? and where&#8217;s the
other person that gets a sign from the public for nothing?&#8221;</p>

<p>Thimble-rigging is peculiarly a Gipsy game. In Great Britain, the
Gipsies nearly monopolize it; and it would be singular if some of the
American thimblers were not Gipsies.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p><a name="Footnote215" id="Footnote215"></a><a href="#FNanchor215"><span class="label">[215]</span></a> There is a Gipsy belonging to one of these bands, known by the soubriquet
of the &#8220;winged duck,&#8221; from having lost an arm, of whom I have
often heard our author speak. He is what may be called the captain of
the company. A description of him, and his way of life, may be interesting,
inasmuch as it illustrates a class of Scottish Gipsies at the present
day.</p>

<p>About the year 1853, three young gentlemen, from the town of Leith, had
occasion to take a stroll over Arthur&#8217;s Seat, a hill that overhangs Edinburgh,
on the east side of the city. In climbing the hill, they observed, a
little way before them, a man toiling up the ascent, whom they did not
notice till they came close upon him, and who had evidently been laying off
on the side of the path, and entered it as they approached it. He appears
about sixty years of age, is well dressed, and carries a fine cane, which he
keeps pressing into the ground, to help him up the hill. Just as they make
up to him, he abruptly stops, and turns round, so as almost to touch them.
&#8220;Hech, how! I&#8217;m blown, I&#8217;m blown; I&#8217;m fairly done up. Young gentlemen,
you have the advantage of me; I&#8217;m getting old, and it is hard for me
to climb the hill.&#8221; (Blown, done up, indeed! The fellow has stamina
enough to outclimb any of them for years yet.) An agreeable conversation
ensues, such as at once gains for him the confidence of the youths. He
appears to them so mild, so bland, so fatherly, so worthy of respect, in short,
a &#8220;nice old cove,&#8221; who is evidently enjoying his <i>otium cum dignitate</i> in his
old age, in some cottage near by, upon a pension, an annuity, or a moderate
competency of some sort. During the conversation, he manages to ascertain
that his young friends have not been on the hill for some time&mdash;that
one of them, indeed, has never been there before. All at once he exclaims,
&#8220;Ah! what can this be? Let us go and see.&#8221; Upon which they step forward
to look at a person like a mechanic playing at the thimbles. Placing
his arm around the neck of one of the young men, he begins to moralize:
&#8220;Pray, young gentlemen, don&#8217;t bet, (they had not shown the least symptoms
of doing that;) it&#8217;s wrong to bet; it&#8217;s a thing I never do; I would advise
you not to do it. This is a rascally thimbler; he&#8217;ll cheat, he&#8217;ll rob you.&#8221;
At this time there are three playing at the board, winning and losing
money rapidly. The &#8220;old cove&#8221; becomes impatient to be gone, and motions
so as to imply, &#8220;Boys, let us go, let us go.&#8221; Moving a few steps
forward, he halts to admire the scenery, (but casts a leering eye in the
direction of the board.) &#8220;Ah! there&#8217;s another goose gone to be plucked;
let us see what luck he meets with.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now thimble rigging is the game, of all others, by which the uninitiated
can be duped. They see the pea put under one of the thimbles, (nutshells
they are, indeed;) there seems to be no doubt of that. The thimbles are
then so gently moved, that any one can follow them. The pea is not afterwards
tampered with&mdash;that is evident. All, then, that remains to be done,
is to lift the thimble under which the pea is, and secure your prize. But
the thimble man, with his long nail, and nimble finger, has secured the pea
under his nail, or, with the crook of his little finger, thrust it into the palm
of his hand, while he pretended to cover it with the thimble. An accomplice,
to make doubly sure of the pea being under the thimble, lifts it, and
shows a pea, which he, by sleight of hand, drops, and, while pretending to
cover it, as nimbly takes it up again.</p>

<p>Betting and playing go on as before. The player makes some fine hauls,
but loses a game. He swears that foul play has been used. An altercation
follows. The man at the board gets excited, and to show that he really is
honourable in his playing, exclaims, &#8220;Well, sir, there&#8217;s your money again;
try another game if you have a mind.&#8221; &#8220;Now that is really honest, and
no mistake about it,&#8221; remarks the &#8220;old cove.&#8221; Then the thimbler averts
his head, to speak to a person behind him, and the &#8220;old cove&#8221; slyly lifts a
thimble and shows the pea, and whispers very confidentially to his friends,
&#8220;Now, young gentlemen, you can safely bet a few shillings on that.&#8221; They
shake their heads, however, for they know too much about thimbling. The
&#8220;old cove&#8221; now gets fidgety, and, managing to edge a little away from the
board, commences, in a subdued tone, to speak, in a strange gibberish, to
another bystander; but, forgetting himself, drops a word rather louder
than the others, on which, as he turns round and catches the eyes of his
young friends, he coughs and hems. On hearing the gibberish, a fear steals
over the young men, on finding themselves surrounded by a band of desperadoes,
in so solitary a place, and they make haste to be off. But the
&#8220;old cove,&#8221; to quiet their suspicions, accompanies them to a convenient
spot, where he leaves them, to go to his home, by a side-path that soon
leads him out of sight. On separating, he looks around him at the scenery,
now lets fall his stick, now picks up something, that he may, with less suspicion,
watch the movements of his escaped victims. They feel a singular
relief in getting rid of his company, and, with tact, dog him over the hill,
till they see him go back to the thimblers. They then think over their
adventure, and the strange jargon they have heard, and unanimously exclaim,
&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t he a slippery old serpent, after all!&#8221;</p>

<p>On this occasion, there were no less than fourteen of these fellows present,
some of them stationed here, some there, while they kept artfully moving
around and about the hill, so as not to appear connected, but frequently
approached the board, to contribute to and watch their luck. They personated
various characters. One of them played the country lout, whose
dress, gait, gape, and stare were inimitable. On the slightest symptom of
danger manifesting itself, they would, by the movement of a hat, scatter,
and vanish in an instant.</p>

<p>Among the people generally, a mystery attaches to these and other
thimble-men. No one seems to know any thing about them&mdash;who they are
or where they come from&mdash;and yet they are seen flitting everywhere through
the country; but hardly ever two days together in one dress. But the
mystery is solved by their being Gipsies. They are dangerous fellows to
meddle with; yet they seem to prefer thimbling, chain-dropping, card-playing,
pocket-picking, in fairs and thoroughfares, and pigeon-plucking
in every form, to robbery on the high-way, after the manner of their ancestors.</p>

<p>Thimble-rigging, according to Sir J. Gardner Wilkinson, was practised
in ancient Egypt. He calls it &#8220;thimble-rig, or the game of cups, under
which a ball was put, while the opposite party guessed under which of four
it was concealed.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote216" id="Footnote216"></a><a href="#FNanchor216"><span class="label">[216]</span></a> &#8220;The opinion, that the Gipsies came originally from India, seems to
have been very early entertained, although it was again soon forgotten, or
silently relinquished. Hieronymus Foroliviensis, in the nineteenth volume
of Muratori, says, that on the 7th day of August, A. D. 1422, 200 of the
Cingari came to his native town, and remained there two days, on their
way to Rome, and that some of them said that they came from India, &#8216;<i>et
ut audivi aliqui dicebant quod erant de Indi&acirc;</i>;&#8217; and the account which Munster
gives of what he gathered from one of the Cingari, in 1524, seems to
prove that an impression existed amongst them of their having come from
that country.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Bright.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote217" id="Footnote217"></a><a href="#FNanchor217"><span class="label">[217]</span></a> Mr. Baird&#8217;s Missionary Report contained a collation of the Scottish
Gipsy with Hindostanee, but that appeared considerably after what our
author has said was written.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote218" id="Footnote218"></a><a href="#FNanchor218"><span class="label">[218]</span></a> Meeting a Bengalee at Peebles, begging money to pay his passage back
to India, I repeated to him, from memory, a few of the Gipsy words I had
collected a week before. After listening attentively, he answered that it
was the Moor&#8217;s language I had got, and gave me the English of <i>paunie</i>,
water, and <i>davies</i>, day. I took the first opportunity of mentioning this interview
to the Gipsies, observing it was the general opinion that their forefathers
came from India. They, however, persisted in their own tradition,
that they were a tribe of Ethiopians, which is believed by all the Scottish
Gipsies. [See <a href="#Page_113">pages 113</a> and <a href="#Page_315">315</a>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p><a name="Footnote219" id="Footnote219"></a><a href="#FNanchor219"><span class="label">[219]</span></a> A lady who resided seventeen years in India, already alluded to, mentioned
to me that the pronunciation of the Hindoos is broad, like that of
the Scotch, particularly where the letter a occurs; and that the Scotch
learn Hindostanee sooner, and more correctly, than the natives of other
countries. For this reason, I am inclined to think that the Scottish Gipsy
will have a greater resemblance to Hindostanee than the Gipsy of some
other countries.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote220" id="Footnote220"></a><a href="#FNanchor220"><span class="label">[220]</span></a> In the report of the Fourteenth Gipsies&#8217; Festival, held at Southampton,
under the superintendence of the Rev. James Crabb, the Gipsies&#8217; friend, on
the 25th December, 1841, is the following statement:</p>

<p>&#8220;The above gentleman, (the Rev. J. West, one of the speakers at the
festival,) with the Rev. Mr. Crabb, and two elderly Gipsies, who speak the
Gipsy language, called, the following morning, on a lady who had long
resided in India, and speaks the Hindostanee language; and it was clear
that many of the Rommany (Gipsy) words were pure Hindostanee, and
other words strongly resembled that language.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Hampshire Advertiser,
1st January, 1842.</i></p>

<p>This statement, made some years subsequent to the period at which I
took down the words from Lobbs and the Gipsies in Scotland, is nearly in
my own words, and proves that my opinion, as to the close affinity between
Hindostanee and the Scottish Gipsy language, is correct.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote221" id="Footnote221"></a><a href="#FNanchor221"><span class="label">[221]</span></a> The four last of these numerals, in the Scottish Gipsy language, differ very considerably from the corresponding ones in the Table. I leave
the matter to be settled by philologists.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote222" id="Footnote222"></a><a href="#FNanchor222"><span class="label">[222]</span></a> It is remarkable, considering how much the habits and occupations of
the Gipsies bring them in contact with beggars, thieves, and other bad
and disorderly characters, how few of the slang words used by such persons
have been adopted by them.&mdash;<i>Rev. Mr. Baird&#8217;s Missionary Report to
the Scottish Church, 1840.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote223" id="Footnote223"></a><a href="#FNanchor223"><span class="label">[223]</span></a> Of the Highland Gipsies, I had the following account from a person of
observation, and highly worthy of credit: There are many settled in Kintyre,
who travel through the Highlands and Lowlands annually. They
certainly speak, among themselves, a language totally distinct from either
Gaelic or Lowland Scotch.&mdash;<i>Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote224" id="Footnote224"></a><a href="#FNanchor224"><span class="label">[224]</span></a> &#8220;There is reason for supposing that the Gipsies had been wandering in
the remote regions of Sclavonia, for a considerable time previous to entering
Bohemia&mdash;the first civilized country of Europe in which they made
their appearance; as their language abounds with words of Sclavonic
origin, which could not have been adopted in a hasty passage through a
wild and half populated country.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Borrow.</i></p>

<p>That the Gipsies were, in some way, drawn together, at a very remote
age, and became amalgamated, so as to form a race, can hardly admit of a
doubt. But it is an opinion that has no reasonable foundation which supposes
that they suddenly took their departure from India, and travelled
together, till they entered and spread over Europe. They may, as I have
conjectured in the <a href="#Page_55">Introduction</a>, have separated into bands, and passed into
countries in Asia, as they have done in Europe; and existed in Asia, and
Africa, long before they appeared in Europe. For this reason, their language
ought to vary in different countries; and it would be enough to
identify them as the same race, were the substance of their language and
their customs, or even their cast of mind, the same. In speaking of the
Hungarian Gipsies, Grellmann says, that their speech contains words from
the Turkish, Sclavonian, Greek, Latin, Wallachian, Hungarian, and German;
but that it would not be absurd to pronounce that there remain more, or at
least different, Gipsy words among those residing in one country than another.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>PRESENT CONDITION AND NUMBER OF THE GIPSIES IN SCOTLAND.</h3>

<p>Every author who has written on the subject of the Gipsies
has, I believe, represented them as all having remarkably
dark hair, black eyes, and swarthy complexions. This
notion has been carried to such an extent, that Hume, on the
criminal laws of Scotland, thinks the black eyes should
make part of the evidence in proving an individual to be of
the Gipsy race. The Gipsies, in Scotland, of the last century,
were of all complexions, varying from light flaxen hair,
and blue eyes, and corresponding complexions, to hair of
raven black, dark eyes, and swarthy countenances. Many
of them had deep-red and light-yellow hair, with very fair
complexions. I am convinced that one-half of the Gipsies
in Scotland, at the present day, have blue eyes, instead of
black ones. According to the statistical account of the
parish of Borthwick, Mid-Lothian, (1839,) the Baillies, Wilsons,
and Taits, at Middleton, the descendants of the old
Tweed-dale Gipsies, are described as, &#8220;in general, of a
colour rather cadaverous, or of a darkish pale; their cheek-bones
high; their eyes small, and light coloured; their hair
of a dingy white or red colour, and wiry; and their skin,
drier and of a tougher texture than that of the people of
this country.&#8221; This question of colour has been illustrated
in my enquiry into the history of the Gipsy language; for
the language is the only satisfactory thing by which to test
a Gipsy, let his colour be what it may.</p>

<p>In other countries, besides Scotland, the Gipsies are not all
of one uniform swarthy hue. A Russian gentleman stated
to me that many of the Gipsies in Finland have light hair,
and fair complexions. I am also informed there are Gipsies
in Arabia with fair hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>Among many other mal-practices, the Gipsies have, in all
countries, been accused of stealing children; but what became
of these kidnapped infants, no one appears to have
given any account, that I am aware of. To satisfy myself
on this trait of their character, I enquired of a Gipsy the
reasons which induced his tribe to steal children. He candidly
acknowledged the practice, and said that the stolen
children were adopted as members of the tribe, and instructed
in the language, and all the mysteries of the body.
They became, he said, equally hardy, clever, and expert in
all the practices of the fraternity. The male Gipsies were
very fond of marrying the stolen females. Some of the kidnapped
children were made servants, or, rather, a sort of
slaves, to the tribe. They considered that the occasional
introduction of another race into their own, and mixing the
Gipsy blood, in that manner, invigorated and strengthened
their race. In this manner would the Gipsies alter the
complexion of their race, by the introduction of foreign
blood among them.<a name="FNanchor225" id="FNanchor225"></a><a href="#Footnote225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>Before going into details to show the condition in which
the Gipsies are at the present day, I will consider, shortly,
the causes which have contributed to the change that has
come over their outward circumstances, and driven so many
of them, as it were, &#8220;to cover,&#8221; in consequence of the unfortunate
times on which they had fallen; a state of things
which, however unfortunate to them, in their peculiar way
of thinking, has been of so much benefit to civilization, and
society at large.</p>

<p>About the commencement of the American war of independence,
in 1775, the Gipsies, in Scotland, occupied a very
singular position in society. Instead of being the proscribed,
and, as they thought, persecuted, members of the community,
many of them then became the <i>preservers</i> of the peace and
good order of the country. The country, as appears by the
periodical publications of the day, was, about this time,
greatly pestered by rogues and vagabonds. The Gipsies
had art enough to get a number of their chiefs appointed
constables, peace-officers, and <i>country-keepers</i>, in several
counties in Scotland. These public officers were to clear
the country of all idle vagrants, vagabonds, and disturbers
of the peace. This was, sure enough, a very extraordinary
employment for the Gipsies. The situation of country-keeper
was, of all others, the office in society the most completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
to their liking. It gave them authority over every
rogue in the country, and they certainly followed out their
instructions to the very letter. They hunted down, with
the utmost vigilance, every delinquent who was not of their
tribe; but, on the other hand, they took especial care to
protect every individual of their own fraternity, excepting
those that were obnoxious to themselves. When it agreed
with their inclinations, these Gipsy country-keepers sometimes
caused stolen property to be returned to the owners, as
if it had been done by magic. It is needless to observe that
they were themselves the very chiefs of the depredators, but
had generally the dexterity never to be seen in the transactions.<a name="FNanchor226" id="FNanchor226"></a><a href="#Footnote226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>A Gipsy country-keeper was at the height of his vanity
and glory, when he got an unfortunate individual of the
community into his clutches. In the presence of his captive,
he would draw his sword, flourish it in the air, and swear a
terrible oath, that he would, at a blow, cut the head from
his body, if he made the least attempt at escape.</p>

<p>The public services of the Gipsies were in a short time
discontinued, as their conduct only made matters a great
deal worse. A friend of mine<a name="FNanchor227" id="FNanchor227"></a><a href="#Footnote227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> saw those Gipsy constables,
for Peebles-shire, sworn into office, at the town of Peebles,
when they were first appointed. He said he never saw
such a set of gloomy, strange-looking fellows, in his life;
and expressed his surprise at the conduct of the county
magistrates, for employing such banditti as conservators of
the public peace. The most extraordinary circumstance
attending their appointment, he said, was, that not one of
them had a permanent residence within the county.</p>

<p>During the American war, however, the tide of fortune
again completely turned against the Gipsies. The Government
was in need of soldiers and sailors; the Gipsies were
a proscribed race; their peculiar habits were continually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
involving them in serious scrapes and difficulties; the consequence
was, that the Tinklers were apprehended all over
the country, and forced into our fleets and armies then
serving in America. All the aged persons of intelligence
with whom I have conversed on this subject, agree in representing
that the kidnapping system at that period was the
means of greatly breaking up and dispersing the Gipsy
bands in Scotland. From this blow these unruly vagrants
have never recovered their former position in the country.<a name="FNanchor228" id="FNanchor228"></a><a href="#Footnote228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>The war in America had been concluded only a few years
before that with France broke out. Our army and navy
were, of necessity, again augmented to an extent beyond
precedent. It was not difficult to find pretences for renewing
the chase of the Gipsies, and apprehending them, under
the name of vagrants and disorderly persons. They were
again compelled to enlist into our regiments, and embark
on board our ships of war, as sailors and marines. An individual
stated to me that, about the commencement of this
war, he had seen English Gipsies sent, in scores at a time,
on board of men-of-war, in the Downs.</p>

<p>But, rather than be forced into a service so much against
their inclinations, numerous instances occurred of Gipsies
voluntarily mutilating themselves. In the very custody of
press-gangs, and other hardened kidnappers, the determined
Gipsies have, with hatchets, razors, and other sharp instruments,
struck from their hands a thumb, or finger or two,
to render them unfit for a military life. Several instances
have come to my knowledge of these resolute acts of the
Scottish Gipsies. I have myself seen several of the tribe
without fingers; and, on enquiry, I found that they themselves
had struck them from their hands, in consequence of
their aversion to become soldiers and sailors. One man, of
the name of Graham, during the last war, laid his hand upon
a block of wood, and, in a twinkling, struck, with a hatchet,
his thumb from one of his hands. Another, of the name
of Gordon, struck two of his fingers from one of his hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
with a razor. Such, indeed, was the aversion which the
whole Gipsy race had to a military life, that even mothers
sometimes mutilated their infants, by cutting off certain fingers,
to render them, when they became men, entirely incapable
of serving in either the army or navy.<a name="FNanchor229" id="FNanchor229"></a><a href="#Footnote229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>Such causes as these, taken in connection with the improved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
internal administration of the country, and the progression
of the age, have cast a complexion over the outward aspect
of the bulk of the Scottish Gipsy race, entirely different
from what it was before they came into existence.</p>

<p>Many of the Gipsies now keep shops of earthen-ware,
china, and crystal. Some of them, I am informed on the
best authority, have from one to eight thousand pounds invested
in this line of business.<a name="FNanchor230" id="FNanchor230"></a><a href="#Footnote230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> I am disposed to think that
few of these shops were established prior to the commencement
of the French war; as I find that several of their
owners travelled the country in their early years. Perhaps
the fear of being apprehended as vagrants, and compelled
to enter the army or navy, forced some of the better sort to
settle in towns.<a name="FNanchor231" id="FNanchor231"></a><a href="#Footnote231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> Like their tribe in other countries, numbers
of our Scottish Gipsies deal in horses; others keep
public-houses; and some of them, as innkeepers, will, in
heritable and moveable property, possess, perhaps, two or
three thousand pounds. These innkeepers and stone-ware
merchants are scarcely to be distinguished as Gipsies; yet
they all retain the language, and converse in it, among
themselves. The females, as is their custom, are particularly
active in managing the affairs of their respective concerns.</p>

<p>Many of them have betaken themselves to some of the
regular occupations of the country, such as coopers, shoemakers,
and plumbers; some are masons&mdash;an occupation to
which they seem to have a partiality. Some of them are
members of masons&#8217; lodges. There are many of them itinerant
bell-hangers, and umbrella-menders. Among them
there are tin-smiths, braziers, and cutlers, in great numbers;
and the tribe also furnish a proportion of chimney-sweeps.
I recollect of a Gipsy, who travelled the country, selling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
earthen-ware, becoming, in the end, a master-sweep. Several
were, and I believe are, constables; and I am inclined to
think that the police establishments, in large as well as
small towns, contain some of the fraternity.<a name="FNanchor232" id="FNanchor232"></a><a href="#Footnote232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> Individuals
of the female Gipsies are employed as servants, in the families
of respectable persons, in town and country. Some of
them have been ladies&#8217; maids, and even house-keepers to
clergymen and farmers.<a name="FNanchor233" id="FNanchor233"></a><a href="#Footnote233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> I heard of one, in a very respectable
family, who was constantly boasting of her ancient
and high descent; her father being a Baillie, and her
mother a Faa&mdash;the two principal families in Scotland.
Some of those persons who sell gingerbread at fairs, or
what the country-people call <i>rowly-powly-men</i>, are also of
the Gipsy race. Almost all these individuals hawking earthen-ware
through the country, with carts, and a large proportion
of those hawking japan and white-iron goods, are
Gipsies.</p>

<p>Some of the itinerant venders of inferior sorts of jewelry,
part of which they also manufacture, and carry about in
boxes on their shoulders, are of the tribe; and some of
them even carry these articles in small, handsome, light-made
carts. I had frequently observed, in my neighbourhood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
a very smart-looking and well-dressed man, who, with
his wife and family, and a servant to take care of his children,
travelled the country, in a neat, light cart, selling
jewelry. All the family were well dressed. I was curious
to know the origin of this man, and, upon enquiring of one
of the tribe, but of a different clan, I found that he was a
Gipsy, of the name of Robertson, descended from the old
<i>horners</i> who traversed the kingdom, about half a century
ago. He still retained the speech, peculiar dance, and manner
of handling the cudgel, the practices and roguish tricks
of his ancestors. I believe he also practised chain-dropping.
To show the line of life which some of the descendants of
the old style of Gipsies are now pursuing, in Scotland, I will
give the following anecdote, which I witnessed, relative to
this Gipsy jeweller.</p>

<p>I happened to be conversing, about twenty years ago,
with four or five individuals, on a public quay in Fifeshire,
when a smart, well-dressed sailor, apparently of the rank of
a mate, obtruded himself on our company. He said he was
&#8220;a sailor, and had spent all his money in a frolic, as many
thoughtless sailors had done;&#8221; and, pulling out a watch, he
continued, &#8220;he would give his gold watch for a mere trifle,
to supply his immediate wants.&#8221; One of the company at
once thought he was an impostor, and told him his watch
was not gold at all, and worth very little money. &#8220;Not
worth much money!&#8221; he exclaimed; &#8220;why, I paid not less
than ten francs for it, in France, the other day!&#8221; At this
assertion, all present burst out a laughing at the impostor&#8217;s
ignorance in exposing his own trick. &#8220;Why, friend,&#8221; said a
ship-master, who was one of the company, &#8220;a franc is only
worth tenpence; so you have paid just eight and fourpence
for this valuable watch of yours. Do not attempt to
cheat us in this manner.&#8221; At finding himself so completely
exposed, the villain became furious, and stepping close up to
the ship-master, with abusive language, <i>chucked</i> him under
the chin, to provoke him to fight. I at once perceived that
the feigned sailor was a professional boxer and cudgelist,
and entreated the ship-master not to touch him, notwithstanding
his insolence. The &#8220;sailor,&#8221; now disappointed on
all hands, brandished his bludgeon, and retreated backwards,
dancing in the Gipsy manner, and twirling his
weapon before him, till he got his back to a wall. Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
he set all at defiance, with a design that some one should
strike at him, that he might avenge the affront he had received.
But he was allowed to go away without interruption.
This man was, in short, Robertson, the Gipsy travelling
jeweller, disguised as a sailor, and a well-known prize-fighter.</p>

<p>Almost all those cheats called thimble-riggers, who infest
thoroughfares, highways and byways, are also Gipsies, of a
superior class. I have tried them by the language, and
found they understood it, as has been seen in my account of
the Gipsy language.</p>

<p>I need scarcely say, that all those females who travel the
country in families, selling articles made from horn, while
the males practise the mysteries of the tinker, are that portion
of the Gipsies who adhere more strictly to their ancient
customs and manner of life. Some of the principal families
of these nomadic horner bands have yet districts on which
none others of the tribe dare encroach. This division of
the Gipsies are, by superficial observers, considered the only
Gipsies in existence in Scotland; which is a great mistake.
The author of Guy Mannering, himself, seems to have had
this class of Gipsies, only, in view, when he says, &#8220;There are
not now above five hundred of the tribe in Scotland.&#8221;
Those who deal in earthen-ware, and work at the tinsmith
business, call these horners Gipsies; and nothing can give
greater offence to these Gipsy potters and smiths than to
ask them if they ever <i>made horn spoons</i>; for, by asking
them this question, you indirectly call them Gipsies, an appellation
that alarms them exceedingly.<a name="FNanchor234" id="FNanchor234"></a><a href="#Footnote234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>Since the termination of the long-protracted French war,
the Gipsies have, to some extent, resumed their ancient manners;
and many of them are to be seen encamped in the
open fields. There are six tents to be observed at present,
for one during the war. To substantiate what I have said
of the numbers and manners of the nomadic Gipsies since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
the peace, I will give the two following paragraphs, taken
from the Caledonian Mercury newspaper:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Tinklers and vagabonds</i>: The country has been much
infested, of late years, by wandering hordes of vagabonds,
who, under pretence of following the serviceable calling of
tinkers, assume the name and appearance of such, merely to
extort contributions of victuals, and other articles of value,
from the country-people, particularly in lonely districts.
The evil has encreased rapidly of late, and calls loudly for
redress upon those in whose charge the police of the country
districts is placed. They generally travel in bands, varying
in number from ten to thirty; and wherever they pitch their
camp, the neighbours are certain of suffering loss of cattle
or poultry, unless they submit to pay a species of black-mail,
to save themselves from heavier and more irregular contributions.
These bands possess all the vices peculiar to the
regular Gipsies, without any of the extenuating qualities
which distinguish these foreign tribes. Unlike the latter,
they do not settle in one place sufficiently long to attach
themselves to the soil, or to particular families; and seem
possessed of no industrious habits, but those of plunder,
knavery, and riot. The chief headquarters of the hordes
are at the caves of Auchmithie, on the east coast of Forfarshire;
from which, to the wilds of Argyleshire, seems to
be the usual route of their bands; small detachments being
sent off, at intermediate places, to extend the scene of their
plunder. Their numbers have been calculated by one who
lives on the direct line of their passage, through the braes
of Perthshire, and who has had frequent opportunities for
observation; and he estimates them at several hundred.&#8221;&mdash;<i>22d
August, 1829.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;A horde of Gipsies and vagabonds encamped, last week,
in a quarry, on the back of the hill opposite Cherry-bank.
Their number amounted to about thirty. The inhabitants
in that quarter became alarmed; and Provost Ross, whose
mansion is in the vicinity of the new settlers, ordered out a
strong posse of officers from Perth, to dislodge them; which
they effected. The country is now kept in continual terror
by these vagabonds, and it will really be imperative on the
landed proprietors to adopt some decided measure for the
suppression of this growing evil.&#8221;&mdash;<i>3d October, 1829.</i><a name="FNanchor235" id="FNanchor235"></a><a href="#Footnote235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>A gentleman informed me that, in the same year, he
counted, in Aberdeenshire, thirty-five men, women, and children,
in one band, with six asses and two carts, for carrying
their luggage and articles of merchandise. Another individual
stated to me, that upwards of three hundred of the
Gipsies attended the funeral of one of their old females,
who died near the bridge of Earn. So late as 1841, the
sheriff of East Lothian addressed a representation to the
justices of the peace of Mid-Lothian, recommending a new
law for the suppression of the numerous Gipsy tents in the
Lothians. I have, myself, during a walk of two hours,
counted, in Edinburgh and its suburbs, upwards of fifty of
these vagrants, strolling about.<a name="FNanchor236" id="FNanchor236"></a><a href="#Footnote236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>When I visited St. Boswell&#8217;s, I felt convinced, as mentioned
in the last chapter, that there were upwards of three hundred
Gipsies in the fair held at that place. Part of them formed
their carts, laden with earthen-ware, into two lines, leaving a
space between them, like a street. In the rear of the carts
were a few small tents, in which were Gipsies, sleeping in
the midst of the noise and bustle of the market; and numbers
of children, horses, asses, and dogs, hanging around
them. There were also kettles, suspended from triangles, in
which victuals were cooking; and many of the Gipsies enjoyed
a warm meal, while others at the market had to content
themselves with a cold repast. In the midst of the
throng of this large and crowded fair, I noticed, without the
least discomposure on their part, some of the male Gipsies
changing their dirty, greasy-looking shirts for clean ones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
leaving no covering on their tawny persons, but their
breeches; and some of the old females, with bare shoulders
and breasts, combing their dark locks, like black horses&#8217;
tails, mixed with grey. &#8220;Ae whow! look at that,&#8221; exclaimed
a countryman to his companion; and, without waiting
for his friend&#8217;s reply, he gravely added: &#8220;Everything
after its kind.&#8221; The Gipsies were, in short, dressing themselves
for the fair, in the midst of the crowd, regardless of
everything passing around them.</p>

<p>On my return from the English Border, I passed over the
field where the fair had been held, two days before, and
found, to my surprise, the Gipsies occupying their original
encampment. They, alone, were in possession of St. Boswell&#8217;s
Green. I counted twenty-four carts, thirty horses, twenty
asses, and about thirty dogs; and I thought there were upwards
of a hundred men, women, and children, on the spot.
The horses were, in general, complete rosinantes&mdash;as lean,
worn-out, wretched-looking animals, as possibly could be imagined.
The field trampled almost to mortar, by the multitude
of horses, cattle, and sheep, and human beings, at the
fair; the lean, jaded and lame horses, braying asses, and
surly-looking dogs; the groups of miserable furniture, ragged
children, and gloomy-looking parents; a fire, here and there,
smoking before as many miserable tents&mdash;when contrasted
with the gaily-dressed multitude, of both sexes, on the spot,
two days before&mdash;presented a scene unequalled for its
wretched, squalid and desolate appearance. Any one desirous
of viewing an Asiatic encampment, in Scotland, should visit
St. Boswell&#8217;s Green, a day or two after the fair.<a name="FNanchor237" id="FNanchor237"></a><a href="#Footnote237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>The following may be said to be about the condition in
which the present race of Scottish <i>tinkering</i> Gipsies are to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
be found: I visited, at one time, a horde of Gipsy tinsmiths,
bivouacked by the side of a small streamlet, about half a
mile from the town of Inverkeithing. It consisted of three
married couples, the heads of as many families, one grown-up,
unmarried female, and six half-clad children below six
years of age. Including the more grown-up members, scattered
about in the neighbourhood, begging victuals, there
must have been above twenty souls belonging to this band.
The tinsmiths had two horses and one ass, for carrying
their luggage, and several dogs. They remained, during
three cold and frosty nights, encamped in the open fields,
with no tents or covering, for twenty individuals, but two
pairs of old blankets.<a name="FNanchor238" id="FNanchor238"></a><a href="#Footnote238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> Some of the youngest children, however,
were pretty comfortably lodged at night. The band
had several boxes, or rather old chests, each about four feet
long, two broad, and two deep, in which they carried their
white-iron plates, working tools, and some of their infants,
on the backs of their horses. In these chests the children
passed the night, the lids being raised a little, to prevent
suffocation. The stock of working tools, for each family,
consisted of two or three files, as many small hammers, a
pair of bellows, a wooden mallet, a pair of pincers, a pair of
large shears, a crucible, a soldering-iron or two, and a small
anvil, of a long shape, which was stuck into the ground.</p>

<p>The females as well as the males of this horde of Gipsies
were busily employed in manufacturing white-iron into
household utensils, and the clink of their hammers was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
heard from daybreak till dark.<a name="FNanchor239" id="FNanchor239"></a><a href="#Footnote239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> The males formed the
plates into the shapes of the different utensils required, and
the females soldered and otherwise completed them, while
the younger branches of the families presented them for sale
in the neighbourhood. The breakfast of the band consisted
of potatoes and herrings, which the females and children
had collected in the immediate neighbourhood by begging.
I noticed that each family ate their meals by themselves,
wrought at their calling by themselves, and sold their goods
for themselves. The name of the chief of the gang was
Williamson, who said he travelled in the counties of Fife
and Perth. When I turned to leave them, they heaped upon
me the most fulsome praises, and so loud, that I might distinctly
hear them, exactly in the manner as those in Spain,
mentioned by Dr. Bright.</p>

<p>I have, for many months running, counted above twenty
Gipsies depart out of the town of Inverkeithing, about ten
o&#8217;clock in the forenoon, every day, on their way to various
parts of the country; and I have been informed that from
twenty to thirty vagrants lodged in this small burgh nightly.
Some of the bakers declared that the persons who were the
worst to please with hot rolls for breakfast, were the beggars,
or rather Gipsies, who frequented the place. On one
occasion, I observed twelve females, without a single male
among them, decamp out of the town, all travelling in and
around a cart, drawn by a shagged pony. The whole party
were neatly attired, some of the young girls having trowsers,
with frills about their ankles; and very few would
have taken them for Gipsies. A large proportion of those
miserable-looking females, who are accompanied by a number
of ragged children, and scatter themselves through the
streets, and beg from door to door, are Gipsies. I do not
recollect, distressing as the times ever have been, of having
seen reduced Scotch tradesmen <i>begging in families</i>. I
remember once seeing a man with a white apron wrapped
around his waist, his coat off, an infant in his arms, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
two others at his feet, accompanied by a dark-looking fellow
of about twenty, singing through the town mentioned. They
represented themselves as broken-down tradesmen, and had
the appearance of having just left their looms, to sing for
bread; and many half-pence they received. Suspecting
them to be impostors, I observed their motions, and soon
saw them join other vagrants, outside of the town, among
whom were females. The poor tradesmen were now
dressed in very substantial drab surtouts. They were
nothing but a family of Tinklers. They were proceeding,
with great speed, to the next town, to practise their
impositions on the inhabitants; and I learned that they
had, in this manner, traversed several counties in Scotland.
At a subsequent period, I fell in with another family, consisting
of five children and their parents, driving an ass and
its colt, near the South Queensferry. Upon the back of the
ass were two stone-hammers, and two reaping-hooks, placed
in such a manner as any one, in passing, might observe
them. I enquired where they had been. &#8220;We have been
in England, sir, seeking work, but could find none.&#8221; Few
would have taken them for anything but country labourers;
but the truth was, they were a family of Gipsies, of the
well-known name of Marshall, from about Stranraer. Their
implements of industry, so conspicuously exhibited on the
back of their ass, was all deception.</p>

<p>It is only about twenty-five years since the Irish Gipsies,
in bands, made their appearance in Scotland. Many severe
conflicts they had with our Scottish tribes, before they obtained
a footing in the country. But there is a new swarm of
Irish Gipsies at present scattered, in bands, over Scotland,
all acquainted with the Gipsy language. They are a set of
the most wretched creatures on the face of the earth. A
horde of them, consisting of several families, encamped, at
one time, at Port Edgar, on the banks of the Forth, near
South Queensferry. They had three small tents, two horses,
and four asses, and trafficked in an inferior sort of earthen-ware.
On the outside of one of the tents, in the open air,
with nothing but the canopy of heaven above her, and the
greensward beneath her, one of the females, like the deer
in the forest, brought forth a child, without either the infant
or mother receiving the slightest injury.<a name="FNanchor240" id="FNanchor240"></a><a href="#Footnote240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> The woman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
however, was attended by a midwife from Queensferry, who
said that these Irish Gipsies were so completely covered
with filth and vermin, that she durst not enter one of their
tents, to assist the female in labour. Several individuals
were attracted to the spot, by the novelty of such an occurrence,
in so unusual a place as the open fields. Immediately
after the child was born, it was handed about to every one
of the band, that they might look at the &#8220;young donkey,&#8221;
as they called it. In about two days after the accouchement,
the horde proceeded on their journey, as if nothing
had happened.<a name="FNanchor241" id="FNanchor241"></a><a href="#Footnote241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>But there are Irish Gipsies of a class much superior to
the above, in Scotland. In 1836, a very respectable and
wealthy master-tradesman informed me that the whole of
the individuals employed in his manufactory, in Edinburgh,
were Irish Gipsies.<a name="FNanchor242" id="FNanchor242"></a><a href="#Footnote242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>The Gipsies do not appear to have been altogether free from
the crime of destroying their offspring, when, by infirmities,
they could not be carried along with them in their wanderings,
and thereby became an encumbrance to them. It has,
indeed, been often noticed that few, or no, deformed or
sickly individuals are to be found among them.<a name="FNanchor243" id="FNanchor243"></a><a href="#Footnote243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> The following
appears to be an instance of something like the practice
in question. A family of Gipsies were in the habit of
calling periodically, in their peregrinations over the country,
at the house of a lady in Argyleshire. They frequently
brought with them a daughter, who was ailing of some lingering
disorder. The lady noticed the sickly child, and
often spoke kindly to her parents about her condition. On
one occasion, when the family arrived on her premises, she
missed the child, and enquired what had become of her, and
whether she had recovered. The father said his daughter
was &#8220;a poor sickly thing, not worth carrying about with
them,&#8221; and that he had &#8220;made away with her.&#8221; Whether
any notice was taken of this murder, by the authorities, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
not mentioned. The Gipsies, however, are generally noted
for a remarkable attachment to their children.<a name="FNanchor244" id="FNanchor244"></a><a href="#Footnote244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>Several authors have brought a general charge of
cowardice against the Gipsies, in some of the countries of
Europe; but I never saw or heard of any grounds for
bringing such a charge against the Scottish Gipsies. On
the contrary, I always considered our Tinklers the very
reverse of cowards. Heron, in his journey through part of
Scotland, before the year 1793, when speaking of the Gipsies
in general, says: &#8220;They make excellent soldiers, whenever
the habit of military discipline can be sufficiently impressed
upon them.&#8221; Several of our Scottish Gipsies have even
enjoyed commissions, as has already been noticed.<a name="FNanchor245" id="FNanchor245"></a><a href="#Footnote245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
military is not a life to their taste, as we have already seen;
for, rather than enter it, they will submit to even personal
mutilation. There is even danger in employing them in our
regiments at the seat of war; as I am convinced that, if
there are any Gipsies in the ranks of the enemy, an improper
intercourse will exist between them in both armies.
During the last rebellion in Ireland, the Gipsy soldiers in
our regiments kept up an intimate and friendly correspondence
with their brethren among the Irish rebels.<a name="FNanchor246" id="FNanchor246"></a><a href="#Footnote246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>The Scottish Gipsies have ever been distinguished for
their gratitude to those who treated them with civility and
kindness, during their progress through the country. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
particulars of the following instance of a Gipsy&#8217;s gratitude
are derived from a respectable farmer, to whom one of the
tribe offered assistance in his pecuniary distress. I was
well acquainted with both of them. The occurrence, which
took place only about ten years ago, will show that gratitude
is still a prominent feature in the character of the Scottish
Gipsy.</p>

<p>The farmer became embarrassed in his circumstances, in
the spring of the year, when an ill-natured creditor, for a
small sum, put him in jail, with a design to extort payment
of the debt from his relatives. The farmer had always allowed
a Gipsy chief, of the name of &mdash;&mdash;, with his family,
to take up his quarters on his premises, whenever the horde
came to the neighbourhood. The Gipsy&#8217;s horse received the
same provender as the farmer&#8217;s horses, and himself and family
the same victuals as the farmer&#8217;s servants. So sure was
the Gipsy of his lodgings, that he seldom needed to ask permission
to stay all night on the farm, when he arrived. On
learning that the farmer was in jail, he immediately went to
see him. When he called, the jailer laughed at him, and,
for long, would not intimate to the farmer that he wished to
see him. With tears in his eyes, the Gipsy then told him
he &#8220;would be into the jail, and see the honest man, whether
he would or not.&#8221; At last, an hour was fixed when he
would be allowed to enter the prison. When the time arrived,
the Gipsy made his appearance, with a quantity of
liquor in his hand, for his friend the farmer. &#8220;Weel, man,&#8221;
said he to the turnkey, &#8220;is this your hour, now?&#8221; being displeased
at the delay which had taken place. The jailer
again said to him that he was surely joking, and still refused
him admittance. &#8220;Joking, man?&#8221; exclaimed the
Gipsy, with the tears again glistening in his dark eyes, &#8220;I
am not joking, for into this prison I shall be; and if it is not
by the door, it shall be by another way.&#8221; Observing the
determined Gipsy quite serious, the jailer at last allowed
him to see the object of his search. The moment he saw the
farmer, he took hold of both his hands, and, immediately
throwing his arms around him, burst into tears, and was for
some time so overcome by grief, that he could not give utterance
to his feelings. Recovering himself, he enquired if it
was the laird that had put him in prison; but on being told
it was a writer, one of his creditors, the Gipsy exclaimed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
&#8220;They are a d&mdash;&mdash;d crew, thae writers,<a name="FNanchor247" id="FNanchor247"></a><a href="#Footnote247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> and the lairds are
little better.&#8221; With much feeling, he now said to his friend,
&#8220;Your father, honest man, was aye good to my horse, and
your mother, poor body, was aye kind to me, when I came
to the farm. I was aye treated like one of their own household,
and I can never forget their kindness. Many a night&#8217;s
quarters I received from them, when others would not suffer
me to approach their doors.&#8221; The grateful Gipsy now offered
the farmer fifty pounds, to relieve him from prison.
&#8220;We are,&#8221; said he, &#8220;not so poor as folk think we are;&#8221; and,
putting his hand into his pocket, he added, &#8220;Here is part
of the money, which you will accept; and if fifty pounds
will not do, I will sell all that I have in the world, horses
and all, to get you out of this place.&#8221; &#8220;Oh, my bonnie man,&#8221;
continued the Gipsy, &#8220;had I you in my camp, at the back
of the dyke, I would be a happy man. You would be far
better there than in this hole.&#8221; The farmer thanked him
for his kind offer, but declined to accept it. &#8220;We are,&#8221; resumed
the Gipsy, &#8220;looked upon as savages, but we have our
feelings, like other people, and never forget our friends and
benefactors. Kind, indeed, have your relatives been to me,
and all I have in this world is at your service.&#8221; When the
Gipsy found that his offer was not accepted, he insisted that
the farmer would allow him to supply him, from time to
time, with pocket money, in case he should, during his confinement,
be in want of the necessaries of life. Before leaving
the prison, the farmer asked the Gipsy to take a cup of
tea with him; but long the Gipsy modestly refused to eat
with him, saying, &#8220;I am a black thief-looking deevil, to sit
down and eat in your company; but I will do it, this day,
for your sake, since you ask it of me.&#8221; The Gipsy&#8217;s wife,
with all her family, also insisted upon being allowed to see
the farmer in prison.<a name="FNanchor248" id="FNanchor248"></a><a href="#Footnote248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>This interview took place in presence of several persons,
who were surprised at the gratitude and manner of the determined
Gipsy. It is proper to mention that he is considered
a very honest man, and is a protection to the property
of the country-people, wherever he is quartered. He
sells earthen-ware, through the country, and has, sometimes,
several horses in his possession, more for pleasure than
profit, some of which the farmers graze for nothing, as he is
a great favourite with those who are intimately acquainted
with him. He is about fifty years of age, about six feet in
height, is spare made, has small black eyes, and a swarthy
complexion. He is styled King of the Gipsies, but the country-people
call him &#8220;Terrible,&#8221; for a by-name. It was said
his mother was a witch, and many of the simple, ignorant
people, in the country, actually believed she was one. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
her son believed she possessed supernatural power, will appear
from the following fact: As some one was lamenting
the hard case of the farmer remaining in prison, the Gipsy
gravely said, &#8220;Had my mother been able to go to the jail,
to see the honest man, she possessed the power to set him
free.&#8221;</p>

<p>That numbers of our Gipsies attend the church, and publicly
profess Christianity, and get their children baptized, is
certain; and that many of the male heads of principal families
have the appearance and reputation of great honesty
of character, is also certain. Yet their wives and other
members of their families are, in general, little better than
professed thieves; and are secretly countenanced and encouraged
in their practices by many of those very chief
males, who designedly keep up an outward show of integrity,
for the purpose of deception, and of affording their plundering
friends protection. When the head of the family is believed
to be an honest man, it excites a feeling of sympathy
for his tribe on his account, and it enables him to step forward,
with more freedom, to protect his kindred, when they
happen to get into scrapes. I am convinced, could the fact
be ascertained, that many of the offenders who are daily
brought before our courts of justice are Gipsies, though
their external appearance does not indicate them to be of
that race.</p>

<p>With regard to the education of our Scottish Gipsies, I
am convinced that very few of them receive any education
at all; except some of those among the superior classes,
who have property in houses, and permanent residences. A
Gipsy, of some property, who gave one of her sons a good
education, declared that the young man was entirely spoiled.<a name="FNanchor249" id="FNanchor249"></a><a href="#Footnote249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>
It appears, however, that the males of the Yetholm colony
received such an education as is commonly given to the
working classes; but it is supposed there is scarcely such a
thing as a female Gipsy who has been educated. There
are, however, instances to the contrary; and I know one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
female at least, who can handle her pen with some dexterity.<a name="FNanchor250" id="FNanchor250"></a><a href="#Footnote250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>As to their religious sentiments, I am inclined to think
that the greater part of the Scottish Gipsies are quite indifferent
on the subject. Numbers of them certainly attend
church, occasionally, when at home, in their winter quarters;
but not one of them will enter its door when travelling
through the country.<a name="FNanchor251" id="FNanchor251"></a><a href="#Footnote251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> On Sundays, while resting themselves
by the side of the public roads, the females employ themselves
in washing and sewing their apparel, without any regard
for that sacred day. It appears to me that a large
proportion of them comply with our customs and forms of
worship, more for the purpose of concealing their tribe and
practices, than from any serious belief in the doctrines of
Christianity. I recollect, however, of once conversing with
an aged man who professed much apparent zeal in religious
matters; and I mind well that he stoutly maintained, in
opposition to Calvin&#8217;s ideas on the subject of free grace,
that everything depended upon our own works. &#8220;By my
works in this life,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I must stand, or fall, in the
world to come.&#8221; This very man acknowledged to me that
the Gipsies were a tribe of thieves. But almost all the Gipsies,
when the subject of religion is mentioned to them, affect
to be very pious; speak of the goodness of God to them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
with much apparent sincerity; lament the want of education;
and reprobate, in strong terms, every act of immorality.
This, I am sorry to say, is, in general, all hypocrisy
and deception. There is not a better test, in a general way,
for discovering who are Gipsies, than the expression of &#8220;God
bless you,&#8221; which is constantly in the mouth of every female.<a name="FNanchor252" id="FNanchor252"></a><a href="#Footnote252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>With regard to the general politics of the Scottish Gipsies,
if they entertain any political sentiments at all, I am
convinced they are monarchical; and that, were any revolutionary
convulsion to loosen the bonds of society, and
separate the lower from the higher classes, they would take
to the side of the superior portion of the community. They
have, at all times, heartily despised the peasantry, and been
disposed to treat menials with great contempt, though, at
the very moment, they were begging at the doors of their
masters. In the few instances which have come to my
knowledge, of Scottish Gipsies forming matrimonial connexions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
with individuals of the community, those individuals
were not of the working or lower classes of society.<a name="FNanchor253" id="FNanchor253"></a><a href="#Footnote253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>I believe there are Gipsies, in more or less numbers, in
almost every town in Scotland, permanent as well as periodical
residenters. In many of the villages there are also
Gipsy inhabitants. In Mid-Lothian there are great numbers
of them, who have houses, in which they reside permanently,
but a portion of them travel in other districts, during the
summer season. I have been at no ordinary pains and trouble
in making enquiries regarding the number of the Gipsies,
and the result of my numerous investigations induces
me to believe that there are about five thousand of them in
Scotland, at the present day. Indeed, some of the Gipsies
themselves entertain the same opinion, and they must certainly
be allowed to have some idea of the number of their
own fraternity.<a name="FNanchor254" id="FNanchor254"></a><a href="#Footnote254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>It appears to me that the civilization and improvement of
the body, generally, would be a work of great difficulty. I
would be apt to give nearly the same answer which a Hungarian
nobleman gave to Dr. Bright, when that traveller
asked him if he could not devise a plan for bettering the
condition of the race in Hungary. The nobleman said he
knew of no manner of improving the Gipsies.<a name="FNanchor255" id="FNanchor255"></a><a href="#Footnote255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> The best
plan yet proposed for improving the race appears to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
the one suggested by the Rev. James Crabb, of Southampton,
and the Rev. John Baird, of Yetholm.<a name="FNanchor256" id="FNanchor256"></a><a href="#Footnote256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> One of the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
steps, however, should be a complete publicity to their language,
if that was possible; and encouragement held out to
them to speak it openly, without fear or reproach. Their
secret speech is a strong bond of union among them, and
forms, as it were, a wall of separation between them and
the other inhabitants of the country.</p>

<p>Many of the Gipsies, following the various occupations
enumerated, are not now to be distinguished from others of
the community, except by the most minute observation; yet
they appear a distinct and separate people; seldom contracting
marriage out of their own tribe.<a name="FNanchor257" id="FNanchor257"></a><a href="#Footnote257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> A tradesman of
Gipsy blood will sooner give his hand to a lady&#8217;s maid of
his own race, than marry the highest female in the land;
while the Gipsy lady&#8217;s maid will take a Gipsy shoemaker,
in preference to any one out of her tribe. A Gipsy woman
will far rather prefer, in marriage, a man of her own blood
who has escaped the gallows, to the most industrious and
best-behaved tradesman in the kingdom. Like the Jews,
almost all those in good circumstances marry among themselves,
and, I believe, employ their poorer brethren as servants.
I have known Gipsies most solemnly declare, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
no consideration would induce them to marry out of their
own tribe; and I am informed, and convinced, that almost
every one of them marries in that way. One of them stated
to me that, let them be in whatever situation of life they
may, they all &#8220;stick to each other.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote225" id="Footnote225"></a><a href="#FNanchor225"><span class="label">[225]</span></a> An objection is perhaps started, that these incorporated individuals are
not Gipsies. They have been brought into the body at such an age as to
leave no trace of past recollections, leaving alone past associations. There
was no occasion for such children being either &#8220;squalling infants,&#8221; or of
such an age as was likely to lead them to &#8220;betray the Gipsies,&#8221; as Mr.
Borrow supposes would be the case, when he says that Gipsies have never
stolen children, to bring them up as Gipsies. How are they to discover
their origin, when so many of the body around them have the same colour
of hair and complexion? If the idea has ever entered into their imaginations,
it has led to a greater antipathy towards their own race, and attachment
to the tribe, from the special education which they have received to
those ends. So far as the matter of blood is concerned, they are not what
may be physiologically called Gipsies; and, by being married to Gipsies,
they become doubly attached to the body. What has been said of children
introduced among the Gipsies, in the way described, applies with infinitely
greater force to those born of one of such parents.</p>

<p>Suppose, for instance, that the Spanish race was originally of an exclusively
<i>dark</i> hair and complexion: should we therefore say that a <i>fair</i>
Spaniard, at the present day, was no Spaniard? Or that the Turks of Constantinople,
on account of the mixture of their blood, were not Turks? In
the same manner are Gipsies with white blood in their veins Gipsies. They
may be half-breed, but it would be improper to call them half-caste, Gipsies.
But what are full-blood Gipsies, to commence with? The idea itself is intangible;
for, by adopting, more or less, wherever they have been, others
into their body, during their singular history, a pure Gipsy, like the pure
Gipsy language, is doubtless nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>An English Gipsy acquaintance, of perfect European appearance, who,
for love of race and language, may be termed &#8220;a Gipsy of the Gipsies,&#8221;
admitted that he was only one-eighth Gipsy; his father, a full-blood white,
having married a quadroon Gipsy. He spoke Gipsy with great fluency.
He married a seven-eighths Gipsy. Were his descendants to marry what
are supposed to be pure Gipsies, the result would be as follows: the first
generation, (his children,) would be one-half Gipsy; the second, three-fourths;
the third, seven-eighths; the fourth, fifteen-sixteenths; the fifth,
thirty-one thirty-seconds; and the sixth, sixty-three sixty-fourths. If this
were to go on <i>ad infinitum</i>, the issue would always lack the one part to
make the full blood. But the Gipsies do not calculate their vulgar fractions
so closely as that; the division of the blood doubtless bothers them, so that
they &#8220;lump&#8221; the question. What has been said, is breeding <i>up</i>. Sometimes
they breed <i>down</i>, and sometimes <i>across</i>. Mixing the blood, in this
way, is quite a peculiarity among the English Gipsies. I asked my friend,
if he was sure his wife was a pure Gipsy. He said she was considered
such, (I have put her down at seven-eighths,) but that one of her forefathers
was a fair-haired French Gipsy. According to a well-admitted principle in
physiology, a fair-haired Gipsy, of almost full blood, is by no means so <i>rara
avis in terris</i> as a white crow. Some of the children of my acquaintance
took after himself, and had blue eyes; and others after the mother, and
had black ones. But the English Gipsies, (the tented ones at least,) are
much purer, in point of blood, than their brethren in Scotland. Many of
the Irish Gipsies have very red hair&mdash;fiery and shaggy in the extreme.
Indeed, they seem to be pretty much all of a fairish kind.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote226" id="Footnote226"></a><a href="#FNanchor226"><span class="label">[226]</span></a> The following extract from the Fife Herald, for the 18th June, 1829,
will give the reader an idea of a Scotch &#8220;country-keeper,&#8221; at the time
alluded to: &#8220;A Gipsy chief, of the name of Pat Gillespie, was keeper for
the county of Fife. He rode on horse-back, armed with a sword and pistols
attended by four men, on foot, carrying staves and batons. He appears to
have been a sort of travelling justice of the peace. The practice seems to
have been general. About the commencement of the late French war, a
man, of the name of Robert Scott, (Rob the Laird,) was keeper for the counties
of Peebles, Selkirk, and Roxburgh.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote227" id="Footnote227"></a><a href="#FNanchor227"><span class="label">[227]</span></a> The late Mr. Charles Alexander, tenant of Happrew.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote228" id="Footnote228"></a><a href="#FNanchor228"><span class="label">[228]</span></a> We may very readily believe that almost all of the Gipsies would
desert the army, on landing in America, and marry Gipsy women in the
colonies, or bring others out from home, or marry with common natives,
or return home. Indeed, native-born American Gipsies say that many of
the British Gipsies voluntarily accepted the bounty, and a passage to the
colonies, during the war of the Revolution, and deserted the army on landing.
This would lead to a migration of the tribe generally to America.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote229" id="Footnote229"></a><a href="#FNanchor229"><span class="label">[229]</span></a> &#8220;When Paris was garrisoned by the allied troops, in the year 1815, I
was walking with a British officer, near a post held by the Prussian troops.
He happened, at the time, to smoke a cigar, and was about, while passing
the sentinel, to take it out of his mouth, in compliance with a general regulation
to that effect; when, greatly to the astonishment of the passengers,
the soldier addressed him in these words; &#8216;Rauchen Sie immer fort; verdamt
sey der Preussische Dienst;&#8217; that is: &#8216;Smoke away; may the Prussian
service be d&mdash;&mdash;d.&#8217; Upon looking closer at the man, he seemed plainly to
be a <i>Zigeuner</i>, or Gipsy, who took this method of expressing his detestation
of the duty imposed on him. When the risk he ran, by doing so, is considered,
it will be found to argue a deep degree of dislike which could make
him commit himself so unwarily. If he had been overheard by a sergeant
or corporal, the <i>prugel</i> would have been the slightest instrument of punishment
employed.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Sir Walter Scott: Note to Quentin Durward.</i></p>

<p>Mutilation was also very common among the English Gipsies, during the
French war. Strange as it may appear, the same took place among them,
at the commencement of the late Russian war; from which we may conclude,
that they had suffered severely during the previous war, or they
would not have resorted to so extreme a measure for escaping military duty,
when a press-gang was not even thought of. An English Gipsy, at the latter
time, laid two of his fingers on a block of wood, and, handing his broom-knife
to his neighbour, said, &#8220;Now, take off these fingers, or I&#8217;ll take off
your head with this other hand!&#8221;</p>

<p>During the French war, Gipsies again and again accepted the bounty
for recruits, but took &#8220;French leave&#8221; of the service. The idea is finely
illustrated in Burns&#8217; &#8220;Jolly Beggars:&#8221;</p>

<p>Poosie Nancie and her reputed daughter, Racer Jess, were very probably
Gipsies, who kept a poor &#8220;Tinkler Howff&#8221; at Mauchline.</p>

<p>Gipsies sometimes voluntarily join the navy, as musicians. Here their
vanity will have a field for conspicuous display; for a good fifer, on board
of a man-of-war, in accompanying certain work with his music, is equal to
the services of ten men. There were some Gipsy musicians in the fleet at
Sebastopol. But, generally speaking, Gipsies are like cats&mdash;not very fond
of the water.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote230" id="Footnote230"></a><a href="#FNanchor230"><span class="label">[230]</span></a> Mr. Borrow mentions having observed, at a fair in Spain, a family of
Gipsies, richly dressed, after the fashion of their nation. They had come
a distance of upwards of a hundred leagues. Some merchants, to whom he
was recommended, informed him, that they had a credit on their house, to
the amount of twenty thousand dollars.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote231" id="Footnote231"></a><a href="#FNanchor231"><span class="label">[231]</span></a> In his enquiry into the present condition of the Gipsies, our author
has apparently confined his remarks exclusively to the body in its present
wandering state, and such part of it as left the tent subsequently to the
commencement of the French war. In the <a href="#Page_371">Disquisition</a> on the Gipsies, the
subject will be fully reviewed, from the date of arrival of the race in the
country.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote232" id="Footnote232"></a><a href="#FNanchor232"><span class="label">[232]</span></a> This is quite common. An English mixed Gipsy spontaneously informed
me that he had been a constable In L&mdash;&mdash;, and that he had a cousin
who was lately a <i>runner</i> in the police establishment of M&mdash;&mdash;. Among
other motives for the Gipsies joining the police is the following: that such
is their dislike for the people among whom they live, owing to the prejudice
which is entertained against them, that nothing gives them greater
satisfaction than being the instruments of affronting and punishing their
hereditary enemies. Besides this, the lounging and idle kind of life, coupled
with the activity, of a constable, is pretty much to their natural disposition.
An intelligent mixed Gipsy is calculated to make a first-rate constable
and thief-catcher. Of course, he will not be very hard on those of
his own race who come in his way.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote233" id="Footnote233"></a><a href="#FNanchor233"><span class="label">[233]</span></a> Our author frequently spoke of a dissenting Scottish clergyman having
been married to a Gipsy, but was not aware, as far as I know, of the circumstances
under which the marriage took place. The clergyman was not,
in all probability, aware that he was taking a Gipsy to his bosom; and as
little did the public generally; but it was well known to the initiated that
both her father and mother had cut and divided many a purse. The unquestionable
character and standing of the father, and the prudent conduct
of the mother, protected the children. One of the daughters married another
dissenting clergyman, which fairly disarmed those not of the Gipsy
race of any prejudice towards the grand-children. The issue of these
marriages would pass into Gipsydom, as explained in the <a href="#Page_371">Disquisition</a> on
the Gipsies.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote234" id="Footnote234"></a><a href="#FNanchor234"><span class="label">[234]</span></a> It is only within these forty years that spoon-making from horn became
a regular trade. It would seem the Gipsies had a monopoly of the business;
for I am informed that the first man in Scotland who served a regular apprenticeship
to it was alive, in Glasgow, in 1836. [There is nothing in this
remark to imply that the manufacturing of spoons, and other articles, from
horn, may not be monopolized by the Gipsies yet, whatever the way in
which it may be carried on.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p><a name="Footnote235" id="Footnote235"></a><a href="#FNanchor235"><span class="label">[235]</span></a> From the numerous enquiries I have made, I am fully satisfied that the
greater part of the vagrants mentioned in these notices are Gipsies; at
least most of them speak the Gipsy language. [It matters not whether the
people mentioned are wholly or only partly of Gipsy blood; it is sufficient
if they have been reared as Gipsies. There are enough of the tribe in the
country to follow the kind of life mentioned, to the extent the people can
afford to submit to, without having their prerogatives infringed upon by
ordinary natives. Where will we find any of the latter, who would betake
themselves to the tent, and follow such a mode of life? Besides, the Gipsies,
with their organization, would not tolerate it; and far less would they
allow any common natives, of the lowest class, to travel in their company.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p><a name="Footnote236" id="Footnote236"></a><a href="#FNanchor236"><span class="label">[236]</span></a> Owing to such causes as these, many of the Gipsies have been again
driven into their holes. It is amusing to notice the tricks which some of
them resort to, in evading the letter of the Vagrant Act. They generally
encamp on the borders of two counties, which they will cross&mdash;passing
over into the other&mdash;to avoid being taken up: for county officers have no
jurisdiction over them, beyond the boundaries of their respective shires.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote237" id="Footnote237"></a><a href="#FNanchor237"><span class="label">[237]</span></a> St. Boswell&#8217;s fair &#8220;is the resort of many salesmen of goods, and, in
particular, of <i>tinkers</i>. Bands of these very peculiar people, the direct descendants
of the original Gipsies, who so much annoyed the country in the
fifteenth century, haunt the fair, for the disposal of earthen-ware, horn
spoons, and tin culinary utensils. They possess, in general, horses and
carts, and they form their temporary camp by each <i>whomling</i> his cart upside
down, and forming a lodgement with straw and bedding beneath. Cooking
is performed outside the <i>craal</i>, in Gipsy fashion. There could not, perhaps,
be witnessed, at the present day, in Britain, a more amusing and
interesting scene, illustrative of a rude period, than is here annually exhibited.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Chambers&#8217;
Gazetteer of Scotland.</i> [This writer is in error as to
the Gipsies annoying the country in the <i>fifteenth</i> century: that occurred
during the three following centuries.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p><a name="Footnote238" id="Footnote238"></a><a href="#FNanchor238"><span class="label">[238]</span></a> The Gipsies&#8217; supreme luxury is to lie, day and night, so near the fire
as to be in danger of burning. At the same time, they can bear to travel
in the severest cold, bare-headed, with no other covering than a torn shirt,
or some old rags carelessly thrown over them, without fear of catching
cold, cough, or any other disorder. They are a people blessed with an
iron constitution. Neither wet nor dry weather, heat nor cold, let the extremes
follow each other ever so close, seems to have any effect upon them.&mdash;<i>Grellmann
on the Hungarian Gipsies.</i></p>

<p>Their power of resisting cold is truly wonderful, as it is not uncommon
to find them encamped, in the midst of the snow, in light canvas tents,
when the temperature is 25 or 30 degrees below freezing point, according
to Raumer.&mdash;<i>Borrow on the Russian Gipsies.</i></p>

<p>It is no uncommon thing to see a poor Scottish Gipsy wrap himself and
wife in a thin, torn blanket, and pass the night, in the cold of December, in
the open air, by the wayside. On rising up in the morning, they will
shake themselves in their rags, as birds of prey, in coming off their perch,
do their feathers; make for the nearest public-house, with, perhaps, their
last copper, for a gill; and, like the ravens, go in search of a breakfast,
wherever and whenever Providence may send it to them.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote239" id="Footnote239"></a><a href="#FNanchor239"><span class="label">[239]</span></a> Some of the itinerant Gipsies, doubtless, use their trades, in a great
measure, as a cover for living by means such as society deems very objectionable.
Many of them work hard while they are at it, as in the above
instance, when &#8220;the clink of their hammers was heard from daybreak till
dark;&#8221; and as has been said of those in Tweed-dale&mdash;&#8220;however early the
farm servants rose to their ordinary employments, they always found the
Tinklers at work.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote240" id="Footnote240"></a><a href="#FNanchor240"><span class="label">[240]</span></a> I know another instance of a Gipsy having a child in the open fields.
It took place among the rushes on Stanhope-hangh, on the banks of the
Tweed. In the forenoon, she was delivered of her child, without the
assistance of a midwife, and in the afternoon the hardy Gipsy resumed her
journey. The infant was a daughter, named Mary Baillie.</p>

<p>[When a Gipsy woman is confined, it is either in a miserable hut or in
the open air, but always easily and fortunately. True Gipsy-like, for want
of some vessel, a hole is dug in the ground, which is filled with cold water,
and the new-born child is washed in it&mdash;<i>Grellmann, on the Hungarian
Gipsies.</i> We may readily believe that a child coming into the world under
the circumstances mentioned, would have some of the peculiarities of a wild
duck. Mr. Hoyland says that &#8220;on the first introduction of a Gipsy child
to school, he flew like a bird against the sides of its cage; but by a steady
care, and the influence of the example of the other children, he soon became
settled, and fell into the ranks.&#8221; It pleases the Gipsies to know that
their ancestors came into the world &#8220;like the deer in the forest,&#8221; and, when
put to school, &#8220;flew like a bird against the sides of its cage.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p><a name="Footnote241" id="Footnote241"></a><a href="#FNanchor241"><span class="label">[241]</span></a> This invasion of Scotland by Irish Gipsies has, of late years, greatly
altered the condition of the nomadic Scottish tribes; for this reason, that
as Scotland, no less than any other country, can support only a certain
number of such people who &#8220;live on the road,&#8221; so many of the Scottish
Gipsies have been forced to betake themselves to other modes of making a
living. To such an extent has this been the case, that Gipsies, speaking
the Scottish dialect, are in some districts comparatively rarely to be met
with, where they were formerly numerous. The same cause may even lead
to the extinction of the Scottish Gipsies as wanderers; but as the descendants
of the Irish Gipsies will acquire the Scottish vernacular in the second
generation, (a remarkably short period among the Gipsies,) what will then
pass for Scottish Gipsies will be Irish by descent. The Irish Gipsies are
allowed, by their English brethren, to speak good Gipsy, but with a broad
and vulgar accent; so that the language in Scotland will have a still better
chance of being preserved.</p>

<p>England has likewise been invaded by these Irish swarms. The English
Gipsies complain bitterly of them. &#8220;They have no law among them,&#8221;
they say; &#8220;they have fairly destroyed Scotland as a country to travel in;
if they get a loan of anything from the country-people, to wrap themselves
in, in the barn, at night, they will decamp with it in the morning. They
have brought a disgrace upon the very name of Gipsy, in Scotland, and are
heartily disliked by both English and Scotch.&#8221; &#8220;There is a family of Irish
Gipsies living across the road there, whom I would not be seen speaking
to,&#8221; said a superior English Gipsy; &#8220;I hate a Jew, and I dislike an Irish
Gipsy.&#8221; But English and Scottish Gipsies pull well together; and are on
very friendly terms in America, and frequently visit each other. The
English sympathise with the Scottish, under the wrongs they have experienced
at the hands of the Irish, as well as on account of the persecutions
they experienced in Scotland, so long after such had ceased in England.</p>

<p>Twenty-five years ago, there were many Gipsies to be found between
Londonderry and Belfast, following the style of life described under the
chapter of <a href="#Page_185">Tweed-dale and Clydesdale Gipsies</a>. Their names were Docherty,
McCurdy, McCloskey, McGuire, McKay, Holmes, Dinsmore, Morrow, Allan,
Stewart, Lindsay, Cochrane, and Williamson. Some of these seem to have
migrated from Scotland and the North of England.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote242" id="Footnote242"></a><a href="#FNanchor242"><span class="label">[242]</span></a> In England, some of the Irish Gipsies send their children to learn
trades. There are many of such Irish mechanic Gipsies in America. A
short time ago, a company of them landed in New York, and proceeded on to
Chicago. Their occupations, among others, were those of hatters and
tailors.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote243" id="Footnote243"></a><a href="#FNanchor243"><span class="label">[243]</span></a> They are neither overgrown giants nor diminutive dwarfs; and their
limbs are formed in the justest proportions. Large bellies are as uncommon
among them as humpbacks, blindness, or other corporeal defects.&mdash;<i>Grellmann
on the Hungarian Gipsies.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote244" id="Footnote244"></a><a href="#FNanchor244"><span class="label">[244]</span></a> The <i>Ross-shire Advertiser</i>, for April, 1842, says: &#8220;Gipsy Recklessness.&mdash;Last
week, two Gipsy women, who were begging through the country, each
with a child on her back, having got intoxicated, took up their lodgings,
for the night, in an old sawpit, in the parish of Logie-Easter. It is supposed
that they forgot to take the children off their backs, when going to
rest; for, in the morning, they were found to be both dead, having been
smothered by their miserable mothers lying upon them through the night.
One of the women, upon awakening in the morning, called to the other,
&#8216;that her baby was dead,&#8217; to which the reply was, &#8216;that it could not be
helped.&#8217; Having dug a hole, they procured some straw, rolled up the
children in it, put them in the hole, and then filled it up with the earth.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote245" id="Footnote245"></a><a href="#FNanchor245"><span class="label">[245]</span></a> Though Gipsies everywhere, they differ, in some respects, in the
various countries which they inhabit. For example, an English Gipsy, of
pugilistic tendencies, will, in a vapouring way, engage to <i>thrash</i> a dozen of
his Hungarian brethren. The following is the substance of what Grellmann
says on this feature of their character:</p>

<p>Sulzer says a Gipsy requires to have been a long time in the army before
he can meet an enemy&#8217;s balls with decent soldiers&#8217; resolution. They have
often been employed in military expeditions, but never as regular soldiers.
In the thirty years&#8217; war, the Swedes had a body of them in the army; and
the Danes had three companies of them at the siege of Hamburg, in 1686.
They were chiefly employed in flying parties, to burn, plunder, or lay
waste the enemy&#8217;s country.</p>

<p>In two Hungarian regiments, nearly every eighth man is a Gipsy. In
order to prevent either them(!) or any others from remembering their descent,
it is ordered, by the Government, that as soon as a Gipsy joins the regiment,
he is no longer to be called by that appellation. Here he is placed promiscuously
with other men. But whether he would be adequate to a
soldier&#8217;s station&mdash;unmixed with strangers, in the company of his equals
only&mdash;is very doubtful. He has every outward essential for a soldier,
yet his innate properties, his levity, and want of foresight, render him
incompatible for the services of one, as an instance may illustrate.
Francis von Perenyi, who commanded at the siege of Nagy Ida, being
short of men, was obliged to have recourse to the Gipsies, of whom
he collected a thousand. These he stationed behind the entrenchments,
while he reserved his own men to garrison the citadel. The Gipsies supported
the attack with so much resolution, and returned the fire of the
enemy with such alacrity, that the assailants&mdash;little suspecting who were
the defendants&mdash;were compelled to retreat. But the Gipsies, elated with
victory, immediately crept out of their holes, and cried after them, &#8220;Go,
and be hanged, you rascals! and thank God that we had no more powder
and shot, or we would have played the devil with you!&#8221; &#8220;What!&#8221; they
exclaimed, bearing in mind the proverb, &#8220;You can drive fifty Gipsies before
you with a wet rag,&#8221; &#8220;What! are <i>you</i> the heroes?&#8221; and, so saying, the
besiegers immediately wheeled about, and, sword in hand, drove the black
crew back to their works, entered them along with them, and in a few
minutes totally routed them.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote246" id="Footnote246"></a><a href="#FNanchor246"><span class="label">[246]</span></a> A Gipsy possesses all the properties requisite to render him a fit agent
to be employed in traitorous undertakings. Being necessitous, he is easily
corrupted; and his misconceived ambition and pride persuade him that he
thus becomes a person of consequence. He is, at the same time, too inconsiderate
to reflect on danger; and, artful to the greatest decree, he works
his way under the most difficult circumstances. Gipsies have not only
served much in the capacity of spies, but their garb and manner of life
have been assumed by military and other men for the same purpose.&mdash;<i>Grellmann
on the Hungarian Gipsies.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Borrow gives a very interesting description of a meeting of two
Gipsies, in a battle between the French and Spaniards, in the Peninsula,
in Bonaparte&#8217;s time. In the midst of a desperate battle&mdash;when everything
was in confusion&mdash;sword to sword and bayonet to bayonet&mdash;a French soldier
singled out one of the enemy, and, after a severe personal contest, got
his knee on his breast, and was about to run his bayonet through him.
His cap at this moment fell off, when his intended victim, catching his eye,
cried, &#8220;<i>Zincali, Zincali!</i>&#8221; at which the other shuddered, relaxed his grasp,
smote his forehead, and wept. He produced his flask, and poured wine
into his brother Gipsy&#8217;s mouth; and they both sat down on a knoll, while
all were fighting around. &#8220;Let the dogs fight, and tear each other&#8217;s
throats, till they are all destroyed: what matters it to us? They are not
of our blood, and shall that be shed for them?&#8221;</p>

<p>What our author says of there being danger in employing Gipsies in
time of war has little or no foundation; for the associations between those
in the opposite ranks would be merely those of interest, friendship, assistance,
and scenes like the one depicted by Mr. Borrow. The objection to
Gipsies, on such occasions, is as applicable to Jews and Freemasons.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote247" id="Footnote247"></a><a href="#FNanchor247"><span class="label">[247]</span></a> A <i>writer</i> in Scotland corresponds with an <i>attorney</i> in England. It is
interesting to notice the opinion which the Gipsy entertained of the writers.
Possibly he had been a good deal worried by them, in connection with the
conduct of some of his folk.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote248" id="Footnote248"></a><a href="#FNanchor248"><span class="label">[248]</span></a> There is something singularly inconsistent in the mind of the Gipsies.
They pride themselves, to an extraordinary degree, in their race and language;
at the same time, they are extremely sensitive to the prejudice that
exists against them. &#8220;We feel,&#8221; say they, &#8220;that every other creature
despises us, and would crush us out of existence, if it could be done. No
doubt, there are things which many of the Gipsies do not hold to be a
shame, that others do; but, on the other hand, they hold some things to
be a shame which others do not. They have many good points. They are
kind to their own people, and will feed and clothe them, if it is in their
power; and they will not molest others who treat them civilly. They are
somewhat like the wild American Indians: they even go so far as to despise
their own people who will willingly conform to the ways of the people
among whom they live, even to putting their heads under a roof. But,
alas! a hard necessity renders it unavoidable; a necessity of two kinds&mdash;that
of making a living under the circumstances in which they find themselves
placed, and the impossibility of enforcing their laws among themselves.
Let them do what they may, live as they may, believe what they
may, they are looked upon as everything that is bad. Yet they are a
people, an ancient and mysterious people, that have been scattered by the
will of Providence over the whole earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is to escape this dreadful prejudice that all Gipsies, excepting those
who avowedly live and profess themselves Gipsies, will hide their race, if
they can, and particularly so, in the case of those who fairly leave the tent,
conform to the ordinary ways of society, and engage in any of its various
callings. While being convoyed by the son of an English Gipsy, whose
family I had been visiting, at their house, where I had heard them freely
speak of themselves as Gipsies, and converse in Gipsy, I said, in quite a
pleasant tone, &#8220;Ah, my little man, and you are a young Gipsy?&mdash;Eh,
what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; &#8220;I don&#8217;t wish to be known to the people as a Gipsy.&#8221;
His father, on another occasion, said, &#8220;We are not ashamed to say to a
friend that we are Gipsies; but my children don&#8217;t like people to be crying
after them, &#8216;Look at the Gipsies!&#8217;&#8221; And yet this family, like all Gipsies,
were strongly attached to their race and language. It was pitiful to think
that there was so much reason for them to make such a complaint. On one
occasion, I was asked, &#8220;If you would not deem it presumptuous, might we
ask you to take a bite with us?&#8221; &#8220;Eat with you? Why not?&#8221; I replied.
&#8220;What will your people think, if they knew that you had been eating with
us? You will lose caste.&#8221; This was said in a serious manner, but slightly
tinged with irony. Bless me, I thought, are all our Scottish Gipsies, of
high and low degree, afraid that the ordinary natives would not even eat
with them, if they knew them to be Gipsies?&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote249" id="Footnote249"></a><a href="#FNanchor249"><span class="label">[249]</span></a> It it well to notice the fact, that by giving a Gipsy child a good education,
it became &#8220;entirely spoiled.&#8221; It would be well if we could &#8220;spoil&#8221;
all the Gipsies. A thoroughly spoiled Gipsy makes a very good man, but
leaves him a Gipsy notwithstanding. A &#8220;thorough Gipsy&#8221; has two meanings;
one strongly attached to the tribe, and its <i>original habits</i>, or one
without these original habits. There are a good many &#8220;spoiled&#8221; Gipsies,
male and female, in Scotland.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote250" id="Footnote250"></a><a href="#FNanchor250"><span class="label">[250]</span></a> The education and acquirements of the Spanish Gipsies, according to
Mr. Borrow, are, on the whole, not inferior to those of the lower classes
of the Spaniards; some of the young <i>men</i> being able to read and write in
a manner by no means contemptible; but such never occurs among the females.
Neglecting females, in the matter of education, is quite in keeping
with the Oriental origin of the Gipsies. The same feature is observable
among the Jews; and the Talmud bears heavily upon Jewish women.
Every Jew says, in his morning prayer, &#8220;Blessed art thou, O Lord, our
God, King of the Universe, who hast not made me a woman!&#8221; And the
woman returns thanks for having been &#8220;created according to God&#8217;s will.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote251" id="Footnote251"></a><a href="#FNanchor251"><span class="label">[251]</span></a> The ostensible reason which the Gipsy gives for not attending church,
when travelling, is to prevent himself being ridiculed by the people. If
he enters a place of worship, he makes the old people stare, and frightens
the children. On returning from church, a child will exclaim, &#8220;Mother,
mother, there was a Tinkler at the kirk, to-day.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;A what? a <i>Tinkler</i> at
the kirk? What could have possessed <i>him</i> to go there?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gipsies are extremely sensitive to the feeling in question. A short time
ago, one of them entered &mdash;&mdash;, in the State of &mdash;&mdash;, with a &#8220;shears to
grind,&#8221; having a small bell attached. Some bar-room gentry assembled
around him, and saluted him with, &#8220;Oh, oh, a Gipsy in a new rig!&#8221; So
keenly did he feel the insult, that he at once left the village.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote252" id="Footnote252"></a><a href="#FNanchor252"><span class="label">[252]</span></a> According to Grellmann, the Gipsies did not bring any particular religion
with them from their own country, but have regulated it according to
those of the countries in which they have lived. They suffer themselves to
be baptized among Christians, and circumcised among Mahommedans. They
are Greeks with Greeks, Catholics with Catholics, Protestants with Protestants,
and as inconstant in their creed as their place of residence. They
suffer their children to be several times baptised. To-day, they receive the
sacrament as a Lutheran; next Sunday, as a Catholic; and, perhaps before
the end of the week, in the Reformed Church. The greater part of them
do not go so far as this, but live without any religion at all, and worse than
heathens. So thoroughly indifferent are they in this respect, as to have
given rise to the adage, &#8220;The Gipsy&#8217;s church was built of bacon, and the
dogs ate it.&#8221; So perfectly convinced are the Turks of the insincerity of
the Gipsy in matters of religion, that, although a Jew, by becoming a
Mahommedan, is freed from the payment of the poll-tax, a Gipsy&mdash;at least in
the neighbourhood of Constantinople&mdash;is not, even although his ancestors,
for centuries, had been Mahommedans, or he himself should actually have
made a pilgrimage to Mecca. His only privilege is to wear a white turban,
which is denied to unbelieving Jews and Gipsies.</p>

<p>Mr. Borrow says, that when the female Gipsies, who sing in the choirs
of Moscow, were questioned, in their own language, about their externally
professing the Greek religion, they laughed, and said it was only to please
the Russians.</p>

<p>The same author mentions an instance in which he preached to them;
taking, for his text, the situation of the Hebrews in Egypt, and drawing a
comparison between it and theirs in Spain. Warming with his subject, he
spoke of the power of God in preserving both, as a distinct people, in the
world to this day. On concluding, he looked around to see what impression
he had made upon them, but the only response he got from them all
was&mdash;a squint of the eye!&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote253" id="Footnote253"></a><a href="#FNanchor253"><span class="label">[253]</span></a> What our author says of the politics of the Gipsies is rather more applicable
to their ideas of their social position. Being a small body in
comparison with the general population of the country, they entertain a
very exclusive and, consequently, a very aristocratic idea of themselves,
whatever others may think of them; and therefore scorn the prejudice of
the very lowest order of the common natives.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote254" id="Footnote254"></a><a href="#FNanchor254"><span class="label">[254]</span></a> Before the reformation of our criminal law, many of the male Gipsies
perished on the gallows, but now, the greatest punishment they meet with
is banishment, or a short imprisonment, for &#8220;sorning, pickery, and little
thieving.&#8221; Few of them are now &#8220;married to the gallows tree,&#8221; in the manner
of Graham, as described under the head of Fifeshire Gipsies. Owing to
their, (the more original kind especially,) all marrying very young, and
having very large families, their number cannot fail to encrease, under the
present laws, in a ratio far beyond that of our own population. Instead of
there being only 5,000 Gipsies in Scotland, there are, as I have already said,
nearer 100,000, for reasons to be given in my <a href="#Page_371">Disquisition</a> on the Gipsies.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote255" id="Footnote255"></a><a href="#FNanchor255"><span class="label">[255]</span></a> Speaking of the attempted civilization of the Gipsies, by the Empress
Maria Theresa, Grellmann says, &#8220;A boy, (for you must leave the old stock
alone,) would frequently seem in the most promising train to civilization;
on a sudden, his wild nature would appear, a relapse follow, and he become
a perfect Gipsy again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Curate.</i>&mdash;Could you not, by degrees, bring yourself to a more settled
mode of life?</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Gipsy.</i>&mdash;I would not tell you a lie, sir; I really think I could not, having
been brought up to it from a child.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Hoyland on the English Gipsies.</i></p>

<p>The restless desire which the more original kind of Gipsies, and those
more recently from the tent, have for moving about, is generally gratified
in some way or other. The poorer class will send their wives and young
ones to the &#8220;grass,&#8221; in company with the nomadic portion, or to the
streets in towns. In either case, they have no great occasion to feel uneasy
about their support; for she would be a poor wife indeed, if she could
not forage for herself and &#8220;weary bairns.&#8221; Among other things, she can
hire herself to assist in disposing of the wares made by another Gipsy. Her
husband will then work at his calling, or go on the <i>tramp</i>, like some of our
ordinary mechanics.</p>

<p>The feeling which mankind in general have for the sweets of the country,
and the longing which so many of us have to end our days in the midst of
them, amount almost to a mania with these Gipsies. Frequently will Gipsies,
in England, after spending the best part of their lives in a settled occupation,
again take to the tent; while others of them, on arrival in America,
will buy themselves places, and live on them till seized with the travelling
epidemic, communicated by a roving company of their tribe accidentally
arriving in their neighbourhood. Some of the more recently settled class
of Gipsies, whose occupations do not easily admit of their enjoying the
pleasure of a country or travelling life, show a great partiality to their
wandering brethren, however poor, with whom they are on terms of
intimacy, and especially if they happen to be related. Their children, from
hearing their parents speak of the &#8220;good old times&#8221;&mdash;the &#8220;golden age&#8221; of
the Gipsies&mdash;when they could wander hither and thither, with little molestation,
and live, in a measure, at free-quarters, wherever they went, grow
impatient under the restraint which society has thrown around them; and
vent their feelings in abusing that same society, and all the members
thereof. They envy the lot of these &#8220;country cousins.&#8221; Meetings of that
kind render these Gipsies, (old as well as young,) irritable, discontented,
and gloomy: they feel like &#8220;birds in a cage,&#8221; as a Gipsy expressed it. Not
unfrequently will a young town Gipsy travel in the company of these
country relatives, dressed <i>a la Tinklaire</i>, as a relief to the discontentment
which a restrained and pent-up life creates within him. At other times,
his parents will know nothing of his movements, beyond his coming home
to &#8220;roost&#8221; at night.</p>

<p>The nomadic class take to winter-quarters in some village, towards the
close of the year, and fret themselves all day long, till, on the return of
spring, they can say, &#8220;To your tents, O Gipsies!&#8221; There is as little direct
relation existing between the tent and the long-settled Gipsies, as there is
between it and ordinary Scotch people. But there is that tribal or national
association connected with it, that is inseparable from the feelings of a
Gipsy, however high may be the position in life to which he may have
risen.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote256" id="Footnote256"></a><a href="#FNanchor256"><span class="label">[256]</span></a> The Fourteenth Annual Festival of the Rev. James Crabb&#8217;s Association,
for civilizing and teaching the principles of Christianity to the Gipsies in
England, was held on the 25th December, 1841. At that time, twenty
Gipsy youths were attending his school. He was very sanguine of ultimately
ameliorating the condition of the British Gipsies.</p>

<p>At Yetholm, in the same year, after the Rev. John Baird&#8217;s school had
been in existence about two years, there were about forty Gipsy children
receiving instruction. When they were educated, they were hired as servants
to families, or bound apprentices to different trades.</p>

<p>[I will offer some remarks on the improvement of the Gipsies, in the <a href="#Page_371">Disquisition</a>
on the Gipsies.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p><a name="Footnote257" id="Footnote257"></a><a href="#FNanchor257"><span class="label">[257]</span></a> It is a difficult matter to tell some of the settled Scottish Gipsies. In
searching for them, some regard must be had to the employment of the individual,
his associations, and his isolation from the community generally,
beyond what is necessary in following his calling and out-door relations, as
contrasted with his hospitality to strangers from a distance; a close scrutiny
of the habits of himself and his numerous motley visitors; the rough-and-tumble
way in which he sometimes lives; his attachment to animals,
such as horses, asses, dogs, cats, birds, or pets of any kind; these, and
other relative circumstances, go a great way to enable one to pounce upon
some of them. But the use of their language, and the effect it has upon
them, (barring their responding to it,) is, at the present stage of their history,
the only satisfactory test. Scottish Gipsy families will generally be
found to be all dark in their appearance, or all very fair or reddish, or
partly very fair, and partly very dark, and sometimes dark or fair nondescript.
Many of the residentary class of mechanic Gipsies are difficult
of detection; so are the better classes, generally, if it is long since their
ancestors left the tent&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>In giving an account of the Gipsies, the subject would be
very incomplete, were not something said about the manner
in which they have drawn into their body the blood of other
people, and the way in which the race is perpetuated; and
a description given of their present condition, and future
prospects, particularly as our author has overlooked some
important points connected with their history, which I will
endeavour to furnish. One of these important points is,
that he has confined his description of the present generation
of settled Gipsies to the descendants of those who left
the tent subsequently to the commencement of the French war,
to the exclusion of those who settled long anterior to that
time. It is also necessary to treat the subject abstractly&mdash;to
throw it into principles, to give the philosophy of it&mdash;to ensure
the better understanding, and perpetuate the knowledge
of it, amid the shifting objects that present themselves to
the eye of the world, and even of the people described.</p>

<p>Gipsydom may, in a word, be said to be literally a sealed
book, a <i>terra incognita</i>, to mankind in general. The Gipsies
arrived in Europe a strange race; strange in their origin,
appearance, habits and disposition. Supposing that their
habits had never led them to interfere with the property of
others, or obtain money by any objectionable way, but that
they had confined their calling to tinkering, making and
selling wares, trading, and such like, they would, in all probability,
still have remained a caste in the community, with
a strong feeling of sympathy for those living in other countries,
in consequence of the singularity of their origin and
development, as distinguished from those of the other inhabitants,
their language and that degree of prejudice which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
most nations have for foreigners settling among them and
particularly so in the case of a people so different in their
appearance and mode of life as were the Gipsies from those
among whom they settled. That may especially be said of
tented Gipsies, and even of those who, from time to time,
would be forced to leave the tent, and settle in towns, or
live as <i>tramps</i>, as distinguished from tented Gipsies. The
simple idea of their origin and descent, tribe and language,
transmitted from generation to generation, being so different
from those of the people among whom they lived, was, in itself,
perfectly sufficient to retain them members of Gipsydom,
although, in cases of intermarriages with the natives,
the mixed breeds might have gone over to the white race,
and been lost to the general body. But in most of such
cases that would hardly have taken place; for between the
two races, the difference of feeling, were it only a slight
jealousy, would have led the smaller and more exclusive and
bigoted to bring the issue of such intermarriages within its
influence. In Great Britain, the Gipsies are entitled, in one
respect at least, to be called Englishmen, Scotchmen, or
Irishmen; for their general ideas as men, as distinguished
from their being Gipsies, and their language, indicate them,
at once, to be such, nearly as much as the common natives
of these countries. A half or mixed breed might more
especially be termed or pass for a native; so that, by clinging
to the Gipsies, and hiding his Gipsy descent and affiliation
from the native race, he would lose nothing of the outward
character of an ordinary inhabitant; while any benefit
arising from his being a Gipsy would, at the same time, be
enjoyed by him.</p>

<p>But the subject assumes a totally different aspect when,
instead of a slight jealousy existing between the two races,
the difference in feeling is such as if a gulf had been placed
between them. The effect of a marriage between a white
and a Gipsy, especially if he or she is known to be a Gipsy,
is such, that the white instinctively withdraws from any connexion
with his own race, and casts his lot with the Gipsies.
The children born of such unions become ultra Gipsies.
A very fine illustration of this principle of half-breed
ultra Gipsyism is given by Mr. Borrow, in his &#8220;Gipsies in
Spain,&#8221; in the case of an officer in the Spanish army adopting
a young female Gipsy child, whose parents had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
executed, and educating and marrying her. A son of this
marriage, who rose to be a captain in the service of Donna
Isabel, hated the white race so intensely, as, when a child,
to tell his father that he wished he (his father) was dead.
At whose door must the cause of such a feeling be laid?
One would naturally suppose that the child would have left,
perhaps despised, his mother&#8217;s people, and clung to those
whom the world deemed respectable. But the case was
different. Suppose the mother had not been prompted by
some of her own race, while growing up, and the son, in his
turn, not prompted by the mother, all that was necessary to
stir up his hatred toward the white race was simply to
know who he was, as I will illustrate.<a name="FNanchor258" id="FNanchor258"></a><a href="#Footnote258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>Suppose that a great iron-master should fancy a Cinderella,
living by scraping pieces of iron from the refuse of his furnaces,
educate her, and marry her, as great iron-masters have
done. Being both of the same race, a complete amalgamation
would take place at once: perhaps the wife was the
best person of the two. Silly people might sneer at such a
marriage; but if no objection attached to the personal character
of the woman, she might be received into society at
once, and admired by some, and envied by others, particularly
if she had no &#8220;low relations&#8221; living near her. She
might even boast of having been a Cinderella, if it happened
to be well known; in which case she might be deemed free
of pride, and consequently a very sensible, amiable woman,
and worthy of every admiration.</p>

<p>But who ever heard of such a thing taking place with a
Gipsy? Suppose a Gipsy elevated to such a position as that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
spoken of; she would not, she dare not, mention her descent
to any one not of her own race, and far less would she give
an <i>expos&eacute;</i> of Gipsydom; for she instinctively perceives, or
at least believes, that, such is the prejudice against her race,
people would avoid her as something horridly frightful, although
she might be the finest woman in the world. Who
ever heard of a civilized Gipsy, before Mr. Borrow mentioned
those having attained to such an eminent position in
society at Moscow? Are there none such elsewhere than in
Moscow? There are many in Scotland. It is this unfortunate
prejudice against the name that forces all our Gipsies,
the moment they leave the tent, (which they almost invariably
do with their blood diluted with the white,) to hide
from the public their being Gipsies; for they are morbidly
sensitive of the odium which attaches to the name and race
being applied to them. It is quite time enough to discover
the great secret of Nature, when it is unavoidable to enter</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;The undiscovered country from whose bourne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No traveller returns.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As little disposition is manifested by these Gipsies to &#8220;show
their hands:&#8221; the uncertainty of such an experiment makes
the very idea dreadful to them. Hence it is that the constant
aim of settled Gipsies is to hide the fact of their being
Gipsies from other people.</p>

<p>It is a very common idea that Gipsies do not mix their
blood with that of other people. Now, what is the fact? I
may, indeed, venture to assert, that there is not a full-blooded
Gipsy in Scotland;<a name="FNanchor259" id="FNanchor259"></a><a href="#Footnote259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> and, most positively, that in England,
where the race is held to be so pure, all that can be said of
<i>some</i> families is, that they have not been crossed, <i>as far
as is known</i>; but that, with these exceptions, the body is
much mixed: &#8220;dreadfully mixed&#8221; is the Gipsies&#8217; description,
as, in many instances, my own eyes have witnessed.
This brings me to an issue with a writer in the Edinburgh
Review, who, in October, 1841, when reviewing the
&#8220;Gipsies in Spain,&#8221; by Mr. Borrow, says, &#8220;Their descent
is purity itself; no mixture of European blood has contaminated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
theirs.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They, (the stranger and Gipsy,)
may live together; the European vagrant is often to be
found in the tents of the Gipsies; they may join in the fellowship
of sport, the pursuit of plunder, the management of
their low trades, but they can never fraternize.&#8221; A writer
in Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine, on the same occasion, says, &#8220;Their
care to preserve the purity of their race might, in itself,
have confuted the unfounded charge, so often brought against
them, of stealing children, and bringing them up as Gipsies.&#8221;
More unfounded ideas than those put forth by these two
writers are scarcely possible to be imagined.<a name="FNanchor260" id="FNanchor260"></a><a href="#Footnote260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>This mixture of &#8220;the blood&#8221; is notorious. Many a full or
nearly full-blood Gipsy will say that Gipsies do not mix
their blood with that of the stranger. In such a case he
only shuffles; for he whispers to himself two words, in his
own language, which contradict what he says; which words
I forget, but they mean &#8220;I belie it;&#8221; that is, he belies what
he has just said. Besides, it lets the Gipsies down in their
imagination, and, they think, in the imagination of others,
to allow that the blood of their race is mixed. It is also a
secret which they would rather hide from the world.<a name="FNanchor261" id="FNanchor261"></a><a href="#Footnote261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> I am
intimate with English Gipsy families, in none of whom is
full blood; the most that can be said of them is, that they
range from nearly full, say from seven-eighths, down to one-eighth,
and perhaps less. Suppose that a fair-haired common
native marries a full-blood Gipsy: the issue of such an
union will show some of the children, in point of external<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
appearance, perfectly European, like the father, and others,
Gipsies, like the mother. If two such European-like Gipsies
marry, some of their children will take after the Gipsy,
and be pretty, even very, dark, and others after the white
race. In crossing a second time with full white blood, the
issue will take still more after the white race. Still, the
Gipsy cannot be crossed altogether out; he will come up,
but of course in a modified form. Should the white blood
be of a dark complexion and hair, and have no tendency,
from its ancestry, to turn to fair, in its descent, then the
issue between it and the Gipsy will always be dusky. I
have seen all this, and had it fully explained by the Gipsies
themselves.</p>

<p>The result of this mixture of the Gipsy and European
blood is founded, not only on the ordinary principles of
physiology, but on common sense itself; for why should not
such issue take after the European, in preference to the
Gipsy? If a residence in Europe of 450 years has had no
effect upon the appearance of what may be termed pure
Gipsies, (a point which, at least, is questionable,) the length
of time, the effects of climate, and the influence of mind,
should, at least, predispose it to merge, by mixture, into
something bearing a resemblance to the ordinary European;
which, by a continued crossing, it does. Indeed, it soon disappears
to the common eye: to a stranger it is not observable,
unless the mixture happens to be met with in a tent,
or under such circumstances as one expects to meet with
Gipsies. In paying a visit to an English Gipsy family, I
was invited to call again, on such a day, when I would meet
with some Welsh Gipsies. The principal Welsh Gipsy I
found to be a very quiet man, with fair hair, and quite like
an ordinary Englishman; who was admitted by his English
brethren to &#8220;speak deep Gipsy.&#8221; He had just arrived from
Wales, where he had been employed in an iron work. Unless
I am misinformed, the issue of a fair-haired European
and an ordinary Hindoo woman, in India, sometimes shows
the same result as I have stated of the Gipsies; but it ought
to be much more so in the case of the Gipsy in Europe, on
account of the race having been so long acclimated there.
Indeed, it is generally believed, that the population of
Europe contains a large part of Asiatic blood, from that continent
having at one time been overrun by Asiatics, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
mixed their blood with an indigenous race which they met
with there.</p>

<p>Of the mixed Spanish Gipsy, to whom I have alluded, Mr.
Borrow says, that &#8220;he had <i>flaxen hair</i>; his eyes small, and,
like ferrets, red and fiery; and his complexion like a brick,
or dull red, chequered with spots of purple.&#8221; This description,
with, perhaps, the exception of the red eyes, and spots
of purple, is quite in keeping with that of many of the mixed
Gipsies. The race seems even to have given a preference
to fair or red hair, in the case of such children and grown-up
natives as they have adopted into their body. I have
met with a young Spaniard from Corunna, who is so much
acquainted with the Gipsies in Spain, that I took him to be
a mixed Gipsy himself; and he says that mixtures among
the Spanish Gipsies are very common; the white man, in
such cases, always casting his lot with the Gipsies. None
of the French, German, or Hungarian Gipsies whom I have
met with in America are full blood, or anything like it; but
I am told there are such, and very black too, as the English
Gipsies assert. Indeed, considering how &#8220;dreadfully mixed&#8221;
the Gipsies are in Great Britain and Ireland, I cannot but
conclude that they are more or less so all over the world.<a name="FNanchor262" id="FNanchor262"></a><a href="#Footnote262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>The blood once mixed, there is nothing to prevent a little
more being added, and a little more, and so on. There are
English Gipsy girls who have gone to work in factories in
the Eastern States, and picked up husbands among the
ordinary youths of these establishments. And what difference
does it make? Is not the game in the Gipsy woman&#8217;s
own hands? Will she not bring up her children Gipsies,
initiate them in all the mysteries of Gipsydom, and teach
them the language? There is another married to an American
farmer &#8220;down east.&#8221; All that she has to do is simply
to &#8220;tell her wonderful story,&#8221; as the Gipsies express it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
Jonathan must think that he has caged a queer kind of a bird
in the English Gipsy woman. But will he say to his friends,
or neighbours, that his wife is a Gipsy? Will the children
tell that their mother, and, consequently, they themselves
are Gipsies? No, indeed. Jonathan, however, will find
her a very active, managing woman, who will always be
a-stirring, and will not allow her &#8220;old man&#8221; to kindle the
fires of a morning, milk his cows, or clean his boots, and, as
far as she is concerned, will bring him lots of <i>chabos</i>.</p>

<p>Gipsies, however, do not like such marriages; still they
take place. They are more apt to occur when they have
attained to that degree of security in a community where no
one knows them to be Gipsies, or when they have settled in
a neighbourhood to which they had come strangers. The
parents exercise more constraint over their sons than daughters;
they cannot bear the idea of a son taking a strange
woman for a wife; for a strange woman is a snare unto the
Gipsies. If a Scottish Gipsy lad shows a hankering after a
stranger lass, the mother will soon &#8220;cut his comb,&#8221; by asking
him, &#8220;What would she say if she knew you to be a loon
of a Gipsy? Take such or such a one (Gipsies) for a wife,
if you want one.&#8221; But it is different with the girls. If a
Gipsy lass is determined to have the stranger for a husband,
she has only to say, &#8220;Never mind, mother; it makes no
earthly difference; I&#8217;ll turn that fellow round my little finger;
I&#8217;ll take care of the children when I get them.&#8221; I do
not know how the settled Scottish Gipsies broach the subject
of being Gipsies to the stranger son-in-law when he is
introduced among them. I can imagine the girl, during the
courtship, saying to herself, with reference to her intended,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll lead you captive, my pretty fellow!&#8221; And captive she
does lead him, in more senses than one. Perhaps the subject
is not broached to him till after she has borne him children;
or, if he is any way soft, the mother, with a leering
eye, will say to him at once, &#8220;Ah ha, lad, ye&#8217;re among Gipsies
now!&#8221; In such a case, the young man will be perfectly
bewildered to know what it all means, so utterly ignorant
is he about Gipsies; when, however, he comes to learn all
about it, it will be <i>mum</i> with him, as if his wife&#8217;s friends
had <i>burked</i> him, or some &#8220;old Gipsy&#8221; had come along, and
sworn him in on the point of a drawn dirk. It may be that
the Gipsy never mentions the subject to her husband at all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
for fear he should &#8220;take her life;&#8221; she can, at all events, trust
her secret with her children.</p>

<p>Why should there be any hard feelings towards a Gipsy
for &#8220;taking in and burking&#8221; a native in this way? She
does not propose&mdash;she only disposes of herself. She has no
business to tell the other that she is a Gipsy. She does not
consider herself a worse woman than he is a man, but, on
the contrary, a better. She would rather prefer a <i>chabo</i>,
but, somehow or other, she sacrifices her feelings, and takes
the <i>gorgio</i>, &#8220;for better or worse.&#8221; Or there may be considerable
advantages to be derived from the connexion, so
that she spreads her snares to secure them. Being a Gipsy,
she has the whip-hand of the husband, for no consideration
will induce him to divulge to any one the fact that his wife
is a Gipsy&mdash;should she have told him; in which case she
has such a hold upon him, as to have &#8220;turned him round her
little finger&#8221; most effectually. &#8220;Married a Gipsy! it&#8217;s no&#8217;
possible!&#8221; &#8220;Ay, it is possible. There!&#8221; she will say, chattering
her words, and, with her fingers, showing him the
signs. He soon gets reconciled to the &#8220;better or worse&#8221;
which <i>he</i> has taken to his bosom, as well as to her &#8220;folk,&#8221;
and becomes strongly attached to them. The least thing
that the Gipsy can then do is to tell her &#8220;wonderful story&#8221;
to her children. It is not teaching them any damnable
creed; it is only telling them who they are; so that they
may acknowledge herself, her people, her blood, and the
blood of the children themselves.</p>

<p>And how does the Gipsy woman bring up her children in
regard to her own race? She tells them her &#8220;wonderful
story&#8221;&mdash;informs them who they are, and of the dreadful prejudice
that exists against them, simply for being Gipsies.
She then tells them about Pharaoh and Joseph in Egypt,
terming her people, &#8220;Pharaoh&#8217;s folk.&#8221; In short, she dazzles
the imagination of the children, from the moment they can
comprehend the simplest idea. Then she teaches them her
words, or language, as the &#8220;real Egyptian,&#8221; and frightens
and bewilders the youthful mind by telling them that they
are subject to be hanged if they are known to be Gipsies,
or to speak these words, or will be looked upon as wild
beasts by those around them. She then informs the children
how long the Gipsies have been in the country; how
they lived in tents; how they were persecuted, banished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
and hanged, merely for being Gipsies. She then tells them
of her people being in every part of the world, whom they
can recognize by the language and signs which she is
teaching them; and that her race will everywhere be ready
to shed their blood for them. She then dilates upon the
benefits that arise from being a Gipsy&mdash;benefits negative as
well as positive; for should they ever be set upon&mdash;garroted,
for example&mdash;all that they will have to do will be to cry
out some such expression as &#8220;<i>Bien&eacute; rat&eacute;, calo chabo</i>,&#8221; (good-night,
Gipsy, or black fellow,) when, if there is a Gipsy near
them, he will protect them. The children will be fondled
by her relatives, handed about and hugged as &#8220;little ducks
of Gipsies.&#8221; The granny, while sitting at the fireside, like
a witch, performs no small part in the education of the children,
making them fairly dance with excitement. In this
manner do the children of Gipsies have the Gipsy soul literally
breathed into them.<a name="FNanchor263" id="FNanchor263"></a><a href="#Footnote263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>In such a way&mdash;what with the supreme influence which
the mother has exercised over the mind of the child from its
very infancy; the manner in which its imagination has been
dazzled; and the dreadful prejudice towards the Gipsies,
which they all apply, directly or indirectly, to themselves&mdash;does
the Gipsy adhere to his race. When he comes to be
a youth, he naturally enough endeavours to find his way to
a tent, to have a look at the &#8220;old thing.&#8221; He does not,
however, think much of it as a reality; but it presents something
very poetical and imaginative to his mind, when he
contemplates it as the state from which his mysterious forefathers
have sprung.<a name="FNanchor264" id="FNanchor264"></a><a href="#Footnote264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> It makes very little difference, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
case to which I have alluded, whether the father be a Gipsy
or not; the children all go with the mother, for they inherit
the blood through her. What with the blood, the education,
the words, and the signs, they are simply Gipsies,
and will be such, as long as they retain a consciousness of
who they are, and any peculiarities exclusively Gipsy.
As it sometimes happens that the father, only, is a Gipsy, the
attachment may not be so strong, on the part of the children,
as if the blood had come through the mother; still, it likewise
attaches them to the body. A great deal of jealousy
is shown by the Gipsies, when a son marries a strange woman.
A greater ado is not made by some Catholics, to
bring up their children Catholics, under such circumstances,
than is exhibited by Gipsies for their children knowing their
secret&mdash;that is, the &#8220;wonderful story;&#8221; which has the effect
of leading them, in their turn, to marry with Gipsies. The
race is very jealous of &#8220;the blood&#8221; being lost; or that their
&#8220;wonderful story&#8221; should become known to those who are
not Gipsies.</p>

<p>There are people who cannot imagine how a man can be
a Gipsy and have fair hair. They think that, from his having
fair hair, he cannot have the same feelings of what they
imagine to be a true Gipsy, that is, a black-haired one.
One naturally asks, what effect can the matter of colour of
<i>hair</i> have upon the <i>mind</i> of a member of any community or
clan, whether the hair be black, brown, red, fair, or white,
or the person have no hair at all? Let us imagine a Gipsy
with fair hair. How long is it since the white blood was
introduced among his ancestors? Perhaps three hundred
and fifty years. The race of which he comes has been,
more or less, mixing and crossing ever since, but always
retaining the issue within its own community. Is he fair-haired?
Then he may be half a Gipsy; he may be three-fourths
Gipsy, and perhaps even more. At the present day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
the &#8220;points&#8221; of such a Gipsy are altogether arbitrary; some
profess to know their points, but it is a thing altogether uncertain.
All that they know and adhere to is, that they are
Gipsies, and nothing else. In this manner are the British
Gipsies, (with the exception of some English families, about
whom there is no certainty,) members of the Gipsy community,
or nation, as such&mdash;each having some of the blood; and
not Gipsies of an ideal purity of race. What they know is,
that their parents and relatives are Gipsies; that Gipsies
separate them from the eternity that is past; and, consequently,
that they are Gipsies. They, indeed, accept their
descent, blood, and nationality as instinctively as they accept
the very sex which God has given them. Which of the two
knows most of Gipsydom&mdash;the fair-haired or black? Almost
invariably the fair.<a name="FNanchor265" id="FNanchor265"></a><a href="#Footnote265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p>We naturally ask, what effect has this difference in appearance
upon two such members of one family&mdash;the one with
European, the other with Gipsy, features and colour? and
the answer is this: The first will hide the fact of his being
a Gipsy from strangers; indeed, he is ashamed to let it be
known that he is a Gipsy; and he is afraid that people, not
knowing how it came about, would laugh at him. &#8220;What!&#8221;
they would ask, &#8220;<i>you</i> a Gipsy? The idea is absurd.&#8221; Besides,
it facilitates his getting on in the world, to prevent it
being known that he is a Gipsy. The other member cannot
deny that he is a Gipsy, because any one can see it. Such
are the Gipsies who are more apt to cling to the tent, or the
more original ways of the old stock. They are very proud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
of their appearance; but it is a pride accompanied with disadvantages,
and even pain. For, after all, the beauty and
pleasure in being a Gipsy is to have the other cast of features
and colour; he has as much of the blood and language
as the other, while he can go into any kind of company&mdash;a
sort of Jack-the-Giant-Killer in his invisible coat. The
nearer the Gipsy comes to the original colour of his race,
the less chance is there of improving him. He knows what
he is like; and well does he know the feeling that people
entertain for him. In fact, he feels that there is no use in
being anything but what people call a Gipsy. But it is different
with those of European countenance and colour, or
when these have been modified or diluted by a mixture of
white blood. They can, then, enter upon any sphere of employment
to which they have a mind, and their personal advantages
and outward circumstances will admit of.<a name="FNanchor266" id="FNanchor266"></a><a href="#Footnote266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>Let us now consider the destiny of such European-like
Gipsies. Suppose a female of this description marries a
native in settled life, which both of them follow. She brings
the children up as Gipsies, in the way described. The children
are apt to become ultra Gipsies. If they, in their turn,
marry natives, they do the same with their children; so that,
if the same system were always followed, they would continue
Gipsies forever. For all that is necessary to perpetuate
the tribe, is simply for the Gipsies to know who they are,
and the prejudice that exists toward the race of which they
are a part; to say nothing of the innate associations connected
with their origin and descent. Such a phenomenon
may be fitly compared to the action of an auger; with this
difference, that the auger may lose its edge, but the Gipsy
will drill his way through generations of the ordinary
natives, and, at the end, come out as sharp as ever; all the
circumstances attending the two races being exactly the
same at the end as at the beginning. In this way, let their
blood be mixed as it may, let even their blood-relationship
outside of their body be what it may, the Gipsies still remain,
in their private associations, a distinct people, into whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
sphere of human action they may enter; although, in point
of blood, appearance, occupation, character, and religion,
they may have drifted the breadth of a hemisphere from the
stakes and tent of the original Gipsy.</p>

<p>There can surely be no great difficulty in comprehending
so simple an idea as this. Here we have a foreign race introduced
amongst us, which has been proscribed, legally as
well as socially. To escape the effects of this double proscription,
the people have hidden the fact of their belonging
to the race, although they have clung to it with an ardour
worthy of universal admiration. The proscription is toward
the name and race as such, that is, the blood; and is not
general, but absolute; none having ever been received into
society as Gipsies. For this reason, every Gipsy, every one
who has Gipsy blood in his veins, applies the proscription
to himself. On the other hand, he has his own descent&mdash;the
Gipsy descent; and, as I have already said, he has
naturally as little desire to wish a different descent, as he
has to have a different sex. As Finns do not wish to have
been born Englishmen, or Englishmen Finns, so Gipsies are
perfectly satisfied with their descent, nay, extremely proud
of it. They would not change it, if they could, for any consideration.
When Gipsies, therefore, marry natives, they do
not only willingly bring up their children as Gipsies, but by
every moral influence they are forced to do it, and cling to
each other. In this way has the race been absolutely cut off
from that of the ordinary natives; all intercourse between
the two, unless on the part of the <i>bush</i> Gipsy, in the way of
dealings, having been of a clandestine nature, on the side of
the Gipsy, or, in other words, <i>incog.</i> How melancholy it is
to think that such a state of things exists in the British
Islands!</p>

<p>The Gipsy, born of a Gipsy mother and a native father,
does, therefore, most naturally, and, I may say, invariably,
follow the Gipsy connexion; the simplest impulse of manhood
compels him to do it. Being born, or becoming a
member of settled society, he joins in the ordinary amusements
or occupations of his fellow-creatures of both races;
which he does the more readily when he feels conscious of
the incognito which he bears. But he has been brought up
from his mother&#8217;s knee a Gipsy; he knows nothing else; his
associations with his relatives have been Gipsy; and he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
in his veins that which the white damns, and, he doubts not,
would damn in him, were he to know of it. He has, moreover,
the words and signs of the Gipsy race; he is brought
in contact with the Gipsy race; he perceives that his feelings
are reciprocated by them, and that both have the same
reserve and timidity for &#8220;outsiders.&#8221; He does not reason
abstractly what he is <i>not</i>, but instinctively holds that he is
&#8220;one of them;&#8221; that he has in his mind, his heart, and his
blood, that which the common native has not, and which
makes him a <i>chabo</i>, that is, a Gipsy.</p>

<p>The mother, in the case mentioned, is certainly not a full-blood
Gipsy, nor anything like it; she does not know her
real &#8220;points;&#8221; all that she knows is, that she is a &#8220;Gipsy:&#8221;
so that, if the youth&#8217;s father is an ordinary native, the youth
holds himself to be a half-and-half, nominally, though he
does not know what he really is, as regards blood. Imagine,
then, that he takes such a half-and-half Gipsy for a wife, and
that both tell their children that they are &#8220;Gipsies:&#8221; the
children, perhaps, knowing nothing of the real origin of
their parents, take up the &#8220;wonderful story,&#8221; and hand it
down to their children, initiating them, in their turn, in the
&#8220;mysteries.&#8221; These children never doubt that <i>they</i> are
&#8220;Gipsies,&#8221; although <i>their</i> Gipsyism may, as I have already
said, have &#8220;drifted the breadth of a hemisphere from the
stakes and tent of the original Gipsy.&#8221; In this manner is
Gipsydom kept alive, by its turning round and round in a
perpetual circle. And in this manner does it happen, that
a native finds his own children Gipsies, from having, in seeking
for a wife, stumbled upon an Egyptian woman. Gipsydom
is, therefore, the aggregate of Gipsies, wherever, or
under whatever circumstances, they are to be found. It is,
in two respects, an absolute question; absolute as to blood,
and absolute as to those teachings, feelings, and associations,
that, by a moral necessity, accompany the possession of the
blood.</p>

<p>This brings me to an issue with Mr. Borrow. Speaking
of the destination of the Spanish Gipsies, he says: &#8220;If the
Gitanos are abandoned to themselves, by which we mean, no
arbitrary laws are again enacted for their extinction, the
sect will eventually cease to be, and its members become
confounded with the residue of the population.&#8221; I can well
understand that such procedure, on the part of the Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
Government, was calculated to soften the ferocious disposition
of the Gipsies; but did it bring them a point nearer
to an amalgamation with the people than before? Mr. Borrow
continues: &#8220;The position which they occupy is the
lowest.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The outcast of the prison and the <i>presidio</i>,
who calls himself Spaniard, would feel insulted by being
termed Gitano, and would thank God that he is not.&#8221; He
continues: &#8220;It is, of course, by intermarriage, alone, that the
two races will ever commingle; and before that event is
brought about, much modification must take place amongst
the Gitanos, in their manners, in their habits, in their affections
and their dislikes, and perhaps <i>even in their physical
peculiarities</i>, (yet &#8216;no washing,&#8217; as Mr. Borrow approvingly
quotes, &#8216;will turn the Gipsy white;&#8217;) much must be forgotten
on both sides, and everything is forgotten in course
of time.&#8221; So great, indeed, was the prejudice against the
Gipsies, that the law of Charles III, in 1783, forbade the
people calling them Gitanos, under the penalty of being
punished for <i>slander!</i> because, his majesty said: &#8220;I declare
that those who go by the name of Gitanos are not so by
origin or nature; nor do they proceed from any infected
root(!)&#8221; What regard would the native Spaniards pay to
the injunction, that they would be punished for &#8220;slander,&#8221;
for calling the Gipsies <i>Gitanos</i>, in place of <i>Spaniards</i>?
We may well believe that such a law would be a dead letter
in Spain; where, according to Mr. Borrow, &#8220;justice has invariably
been a mockery; a thing to be bought and sold,
terrible only to the feeble and innocent, and an instrument
of cruelty and avarice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Borrow leaves the question where he found it. Even
remove the prejudice that exists against the Gipsies, as regards
their colour, habits, and history; what then? Would
they, as a people cease to be? Would they amalgamate
with the natives, <i>so as to be lost</i>? Assuredly not. They
may mix their blood, but they preserve their mental identity
in the world; even although, in point of physical appearance,
habits, manners, occupation, character, and creed, they
might &#8220;become confounded with the residue of the population.&#8221;
In that respect, they are the most exclusive people
of almost any to be found in the world. We have only to
consider what Freemasonry is, and we can form an idea of
what Gipsyism is, in one of its aspects. It rests upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
broadest of all bases&mdash;flesh and blood, a common and
mysterious origin, a common language, a common history, a
common persecution, and a common odium, in every part of
the world. Remove the prejudice against the Gipsies, make
it as respectable to be Gipsies, as the world, with its ignorance
of many of the race, deem it desreputable; what
then? Some of them might come out with their &#8220;tents and
encampments,&#8221; and banners and mottoes: the &#8220;cuddy and
the creel, the hammer and tongs, the tent and the tin kettle&#8221;
forever. People need not sneer at the &#8220;cuddy and the
creel.&#8221; The idea conveys a world of poetry to the mind of
a Gipsy. Mrs. Fall, of Dunbar, thought it so poetical, that
she had it, as we have seen, worked in tapestry; and it is
doubtless carefully preserved, as an heir-loom, among her
collateral descendants.<a name="FNanchor267" id="FNanchor267"></a><a href="#Footnote267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Borrow speaks of the Gipsies &#8220;declining&#8221; in Spain.
Ask a Scotchman about the Scottish Gipsies, and he will answer:
&#8220;The Scotch Gipsies have pretty much died out.&#8221;
&#8220;Died out?&#8221; I ask; &#8220;that is impossible; for who are more
prolific than Gipsies?&#8221; &#8220;Oh, then, they have become settled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
and civilized.&#8221; &#8220;And <i>ceased to be Gipsies</i>?&#8221; I continue.
&#8220;Exactly so,&#8221; he replies. What idea can be more ridiculous
than that of saying, that if a Gipsy leaves the tent,
settles in a town, and attends church, he ceases to be a
Gipsy; and that, if he takes to the tent again, he becomes a
Gipsy again? What has a man&#8217;s occupation, habits, or character,
to do with his clan, tribe, or nationality? Does education,
does religion, remove from his mind a knowledge of
who he is, or change his blood? Are not our own Borderers
and Highlanders as much Borderers and Highlanders as ever
they were? Are not Spanish Gipsies still Spanish Gipsies, although
a change may have come over the characters and circumstances
of some of them? It would be absurd to deny it.<a name="FNanchor268" id="FNanchor268"></a><a href="#Footnote268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Borrow has not sufficiently examined into Spanish
Gipsyism to pass a reliable opinion upon it. He says:
&#8220;One thing is certain, in the history of the Gitanos; that
the sect flourished and encreased, so long as the law recommended
and enjoined measures the most harsh and severe
for its suppression.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The caste of the Gitanos still
exists, but is neither so extensive, nor so formidable, as a
century ago, when the law, in denouncing Gitanismo, proposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
to the Gitanos the alternatives of death for persisting
in their profession, or slavery for abandoning it.&#8221; These
are very singular alternatives. The latter is certainly not
to be found in any of the Spanish laws quoted by Mr. Borrow.
I am at a loss to perceive the point of his reasoning.
There can be no difficulty in believing that Gipsies would
rather <i>encrease</i> in a state of peace, than if they were hunted
from place to place, like wild beasts; and consequently,
having renounced their former mode or life, they would, in
Mr. Borrow&#8217;s own words, &#8220;cease to play a distinct part in
the history of Spain, and the <i>law</i> would no longer speak of
them as a distinct people.&#8221; And the same might, to a certain
extent, be said of the Spanish <i>people</i>. Mr. Borrow
again says: &#8220;That the Gitanos are not so numerous as in
former times, witness those <i>barrios</i>, in various towns, still denominated
<i>Gitanerias</i>, but from whence the Gitanos have
disappeared, even like the Moors from the <i>Morerias</i>.&#8221; But
Mr. Borrow himself, in the same work, gives a good reason
for the disappearance of the Gipsies from these <i>Gitanerias</i>;
for he says: &#8220;The <i>Gitanerias</i> were soon considered as public
nuisances, on which account the Gitanos were forbidden to
live together in particular parts of the town, to hold meetings,
and even to intermarry with each other.&#8221; If the disappearance
of the Gipsies from Spain was like that of the
Moors, it would appear that they had left, or been expelled
from, the country; a theory which Mr. Borrow does not advance.
The Gipsies, to a certain extent, may have left these
barriers, or been expelled from them, and settled, as tradesmen,
mechanics, and what not, in other parts of the same or
other towns; so as to be in a position the more able to get
on in the world. Still, many of them are in the colonies.
In Cuba there are many, as soldiers and musicians, dealers
in mules and red pepper, which businesses they almost
monopolize, and jobbers and dealers in various wares; and
doubtless there are some of them innkeepers, and others
following other occupations. In Mexico there are not a few.
I know of a Gitano who has a fine wholesale and retail cigar
store in Virginia.<a name="FNanchor269" id="FNanchor269"></a><a href="#Footnote269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>Mr. Borrow concludes, in regard to the Spanish Gipsies,
thus: &#8220;We have already expressed our belief that the caste
has diminished of latter years; whether this diminution was
the result of one or many causes combined; of a <i>partial
change of habits</i>, of pestilence or sickness, of war or
famine, or of a <i>freer intercourse with the Spanish population</i>,
we have no means of determining, and shall abstain from
offering conjectures on the subject.&#8221; In this way does he
leave the question just where he found it. Is there any
reason to doubt that Gipsydom is essentially the same in
Spain as in Great Britain; or that its future will be guided
by any other principles than those which regulate that of
the British Gipsies? Indeed, I am astonished that Mr.
Borrow should advance the idea that Gipsies should <i>decrease</i>
by &#8220;changing their habits;&#8221; they might not <i>encrease so fast</i>,
in a settled life, as when more exposed to the air, and not
molested by the Spanish Government. I am no less astonished
that he should think they would decrease by &#8220;a freer
intercourse with the Spanish population;&#8221; when, in fact,
such mixtures are well known to go with the Gipsies; the
mixture being, in the estimation of the British Gipsies, calculated
to strengthen and invigorate the race itself. Had
Mr. Borrow kept in mind the case of the half-blood Gipsy
captain, he could have had no difficulty in learning what
became of mixed Gipsies.<a name="FNanchor270" id="FNanchor270"></a><a href="#Footnote270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>It doubtless holds in Spain, as in Great Britain, that as
the Gipsy enters into settled life, and engages in a respectable
calling, he hides his descent, and even mixes his blood
with that of the country, and becomes ashamed of the name
before the public; but is as much, at heart, a Gipsy, as any
others of his race. And this theory is borne out by Mr.
Borrow himself, when he speaks of &#8220;the unwillingness of
the Spanish Gipsies to utter, when speaking of themselves,
the detested expression Gitano; a word which seldom escapes
their mouths.&#8221; We might therefore conclude, that
the Spanish Gipsies, with the exception of the more original
and bigoted stock, would <i>hide their nationality</i> from the common
Spaniards, and so escape their notice. It is not at all
likely that the half-pay Gipsy captain would mention to the
public that he was a Gipsy, although he admitted it to Mr.
Borrow, under the peculiar circumstances in which he met
him. My Spanish acquaintance informs me that the Gitanos,
generally, hide their nationality from the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Such a case is evidently told by Mr. Borrow, in the vagabond
Gipsy, Antonio, at Badajoz, who termed a rich Gipsy,
living in the same town, a hog, because he evidently would
not countenance him. Antonio may possibly have been
kicked out of his house, in attempting to enter it. He accused
him of having married a Spaniard, and of fain attempting
to pass himself for a Spaniard. As regards the wife,
she might have been a Gipsy with very little of &#8220;the blood&#8221;
in her veins; or a Spaniard, reared by Gipsies; or an ordinary
Spanish maiden, to whom the Gipsy would teach his
language, as sometimes happens among the English Gipsies.
His wishing to pass for a Spaniard had nothing to do with
his being, but not wishing to be known as, a Gipsy. The
same is done by almost all our Scottish Gipsies. In England,
those who do not follow the tent&mdash;I mean the more
mixed and better-class&mdash;are even afraid of each other.
&#8220;Afraid of what?&#8221; said I, to such an English Gipsy;
&#8220;ashamed of being Gipsies?&#8221; &#8220;No, sir,&#8221; (with great emphasis;)
&#8220;not ashamed of being Gipsies, but of being <i>known</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
<i>to other people as Gipsies</i>.&#8221; &#8220;A world of difference,&#8221; I replied.
What does the world hold to be a <i>Gipsy</i>, and what
does it hold to be the <i>feelings of a man</i>? If we consider
these two questions, we can have little difficulty in understanding
the wish of such Gipsies to disguise themselves.
It is in this way, and in the mixing of the blood, that this
so-called &#8220;dying out of the Gipsies&#8221; is to be accounted
for.<a name="FNanchor271" id="FNanchor271"></a><a href="#Footnote271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>It is singular that Mr. Borrow should attribute the change
which has come over the Spanish Gipsies, so much to the
law passed by Charles III. in 1783; and that he should
characterize it as an enlightened, wise, and liberal law; distinguished
by justice and clemency; and as being calculated
to exert considerable influence over the destiny of the race;
nay, as being the principal, if not the only, cause for the
&#8220;decline&#8221; of it in Spain. It was headed: &#8220;Rules for <i>repressing</i>
and <i>chastising</i> the vagrant mode of life, and other excesses,
of those who are called Gitanos.&#8221; Article II. forbids,
under penalties, the Gipsies &#8220;using their <i>language</i>, dress, or
vagrant kind of life, which they had hitherto followed.&#8221;
Article XI. prohibits them from &#8220;wandering about the
roads and uninhabited places, even with the pretext of
<i>visiting markets and fairs</i>.&#8221; Article IX. reads thus: &#8220;Those
<i>who have abandoned the dress, name, language or jargon,
associations and manners of Gitanos</i>, and shall have, moreover,
chosen and established a domicile, but shall not have
devoted themselves to any office or employment, though it
be only that of day-labourer, shall be <i>proceeded against as
common vagrants</i>.&#8221; Articles XVI. and XVII. enact, that
&#8220;the children, and young people of both sexes, who are not
above sixteen years of age, shall be separated from their
parents, <i>who wander about and have no employment</i>, [which
was forbidden by the law itself,] and shall be destined to
learn something, or shall be placed out in hospices or houses
of instruction.&#8221; Article XX. <i>dooms to death, without remission,</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
<i>Gipsies who, for the second time, relapse into their old
habits</i>.</p>

<p>I cannot agree with Mr. Borrow, when he says, that this
law &#8220;differs in <i>character</i>&#8221; from any which had hitherto been
enacted, in connection with the body in Spain, if I take
those preceding it, as given by himself. The only difference
between it and some of the previous laws is, that it allowed
the Gipsy to be admitted to whatever office or employment
<i>to which he might apply himself</i>, and likewise to any guilds
or communities; but it prohibited him from settling in the
capital, or any of the royal residences; and forbade him, <i>on
pain of death</i>, to publicly profess what he was&mdash;that is, a
Gipsy. With the trifling exceptions mentioned, the law of
Charles III. was as foolish a one as ever was passed
against the Gipsies. These very exceptions show what the
letter, whatever the execution, of previous laws must have
been. Nor can we form any opinion as to the effects the
law in question had upon the Gipsies, unless we know how
it was carried out. The law of the Empress Maria Theresa
produced no effect upon the Gipsies in Hungary. &#8220;In Hungary,&#8221;
says Mr. Borrow, &#8220;two classes are free to do what
they please&mdash;the nobility and the Gipsies&mdash;the one above
the law, the other below it.&#8221; And what did Mr. Borrow
find the Gipsies in Hungary? In England, the last instances
of condemnation, under the old sanguinary laws, happened
a few years before the Restoration, although these were not
repealed till 23d Geo. III., c. 54. The Gipsies in England
can follow any employment, common to the ordinary natives,
they please: and how has Mr. Borrow described them
there? In Scotland, the tribe have been allowed to do
nothing, not even acknowledge their existence, as Gipsies:
and this work describes what they are in that country.</p>

<p>Instead of the law of Charles III. exercising any great
beneficial influence over the character of the Spanish Gipsies,
I would attribute the change in question to what Mr.
Borrow himself says: &#8220;It must be remembered that during
the last seventy years, a revolution has been progressing in
Spain, slowly it is true; and such a revolution may have
affected the Gitanos.&#8221; The Spanish Gipsy proverb, &#8220;Money
is to be found in the town, not in the country,&#8221; has had its influence
on bringing the race to settle in towns. And by residing
in towns, and not being persecuted, they have, in Mr. Borrow&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
own words, &#8220;insensibly become more civilized than their
ancestors, and their habits and manners less ferocious.&#8221; The
only good which the law of Charles III. seems to have done
to the Spanish Gipsies was, as already said, to permit them
to follow any occupation, and be admitted to any guilds, or
communities, (barring the capital, and royal residences,) they
pleased; but only on the condition, and that <i>on the pain of
death</i>, that they <i>renounced every imaginable thing connected
with their tribe</i>; which, we may reasonably assume, no
Gipsy submitted to, however much in appearance he might
have done so.</p>

<p>But it is doubtful if the law of Charles III. was anything
but the one which it was customary for every Spanish monarch
to issue against the tribe. Mr. Borrow says: &#8220;Perhaps
there is no country in which more laws have been
framed, having in view the suppression and extinction of
the Gipsy name, race, and manner of life, than Spain. Every
monarch, during a period of three hundred years, appears,
at his accession to the throne, to have considered that one
of his first and most imperative duties consisted in suppressing
and checking the robberies, frauds, and other enormities
of the Gitanos, with which the whole country seems to have
resounded since the time of their first appearance.&#8221; The
fact of so many laws being passed against the Gipsies, is, to
my mind, ample proof, as I shall afterwards explain, that
few, if any, of them were put, to any extent, in force; and
that the act in question, viewed in itself, as distinct from the
laws previously in existence, was little more than a form. It
contains a flourish of liberality, implied in the Gitanos being
allowed to enter, if they pleased, any guilds, (which they
were not likely to do,) or communities, (where they were
doubtless already;) but it debars, (that is, expels,) them from
the king&#8217;s presence, at the capital or any of the royal residences.
Moreover, it allowed the Gitano to be &#8220;admitted to
whatever office or employment to which he might apply himself,&#8221;
(against which, there probably was, or should have
been, no law in existence.) His majesty must also impose
his pragmatical conceit upon his loyal subjects, by telling
them, that &#8220;Gitanos are <i>not</i> Gitanos&#8221;&mdash;that they &#8220;do <i>not</i>
proceed from any infected root;&#8221; and threaten them, that if
they maintain the contrary, and call them Gitanos, he will
have them punished for slander!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>The Gipsies, after a residence of 350 years in the country,
would have comparatively little notice taken of them,
under this law, except when they made themselves really
obnoxious, or gave an official an occasion to display his
authority, or his zeal for the public service.<a name="FNanchor272" id="FNanchor272"></a><a href="#Footnote272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> Whatever may
have been the treatment which the Gipsies experienced at
the hands of the <i>civil</i> authorities, the <i>church</i> does not seem
to have disturbed, and far less distressed, them. Mr. Borrow
represents a priest of Cordova, formerly an Inquisitor,
saying to him: &#8220;I am not aware of one case of a Gitano
having been tried or punished by the Inquisition. The Inquisition
always looked upon them with too much contempt,
to give itself the slightest trouble concerning them; for, as
no danger, either to the State or to the Church of Rome,
could proceed from the Gitanos, it was a matter of perfect
indifference to the holy office whether they lived without religion
or not. The holy office has always reserved its anger
for people very different; the Gitano having, at all times,
been <i>Gente barrata y despreciable</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Should the Spanish Gipsies not now assist each other, to
the extent they did when banditti, under the special proscription
of the Government, it would be absurd to say that
they were therefore not as much Gipsies as ever they were.
The change in this respect arose, to some extent, from the
toleration extended to them, as a people and as individuals,
whether by the law, or society in general. Such Gipsies
as Mr. Borrow seems to have associated with, in Spain,
were not likely to be very reliable authority on the questions
at issue; for he has described them as &#8220;being endowed
with a kind of instinct, (in lieu of reason,) which assists them
to a very limited extent, and no further.&#8221;</p>

<p>Might it not be in Spain as in Great Britain? Even in
England, those that pass for Gipsies are few in number,
compared to the mixed Gipsies, following various occupations;
for a large part of the Gipsy blood in England has,
as it were, been spread over a large surface of the white. In
Scotland it is almost altogether so. There seems considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
reason for believing that Gipsydom is, perhaps, as much
mixed in Spain as in Great Britain, although Mr. Borrow
has taken no notice of it. We have seen, (<a href="#Page_92">page 92.</a>) how
severe an enactment was passed by Queen Elizabeth, against
&#8220;any person, whether natural born or <i>stranger</i>, to be seen
in the fellowship of the Gipsies, or disguised like them.&#8221; In
the law of Ferdinand and Isabella, the first passed against
the Gipsies, in Spain, a class of people is mentioned, in conjunction
with them, but distinguished from them, by the
name of &#8220;foreign tinkers.&#8221; Philip III., at Belan, in Portugal,
in 1619, commands all Gipsies to quit the kingdom
within six months. &#8220;Those who should wish to remain are
to establish themselves in cities, and are not to be allowed
to use the dress, name, and language, in order, that forasmuch
as they are not such by nation,(!) this name, and manner
of life, may be for evermore confounded and forgotten(!)&#8221;
Philip IV., on the 8th May, 1633, declares &#8220;that they are
not Gipsies by origin or nature, but have adopted this form
of life(!)&#8221; This idea of &#8220;Gitanos <i>not</i> being Gitanos, and
<i>not</i> proceeding from any infected root,&#8221; was not original
with Charles III., in 1783; his proclamation having been in
formal keeping with previous ones, whether of his own
country, or, as in Scotland, in 1603, &#8220;recommended by the
example of some other realm,&#8221; (<a href="#Page_111">page 111</a>.) There had evidently
been a great curiosity to know who some of the &#8220;not
Gipsies by origin and nature,&#8221; (evidently judging from their
appearance,) could be; for Philip IV. enacts, &#8220;that they
shall, within two months, leave the quarters where now they
<i>live with the denomination of Gitanos</i>, and that they shall
<i>separate from each other</i>, and <i>mingle with the other inhabitants</i>:
that the ministers of justice are to observe, <i>with particular
diligence</i>, whether they <i>hold communication with each
other</i>, or <i>marry among themselves</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;foreign tinkers&#8221; mentioned in the Act of Ferdinand
and Isabella, and the individuals distinguished from
the Gipsies in that of Queen Elizabeth, were doubtless <i>mixed</i>
Gipsies; whose relationship with the Gipsies proper, and
isolation from the common natives, are very distinctly pointed
out in the above extract from the law of Philip IV. Mr.
Borrow expresses a great difficulty to understand who these
people could be, <i>if not Gipsies</i>. How easy it is to get quit
of the difficulty, by concluding that they were Gipsies whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
blood, perhaps for the most part, was native; and who had
been brought into the body in the manner explained in the
<a href="#Page_5">Preface</a> to this work, and more fully illustrated in this <a href="#Page_371">Disquisition</a>.
If Mr. Borrow found in Spain a half-pay captain,
in the service of Donna Isabel, with <i>flaxen</i> hair, a <i>thorough
Gipsy</i>, who spoke Gipsy and Latin, with great fluency, and
his cousin, Jara, in all probability another Gipsy, what difficulty
can there be in believing, that the &#8220;foreign tinkers,&#8221;
or tinkers of any kind, now to be met with in Spain, are,
like the same class in Great Britain and Ireland, Gipsies of
mixed blood? Indeed, the young Spaniard, to whom I have
alluded, informs me that the Gipsies in Spain are very much
mixed. Mr. Borrow himself admits that the Gipsy blood in
Spain has been mixed; for, in speaking of the old Gipsy
counts, he says: &#8220;It was the counts who determined what individuals
were to be admitted into the fellowship and privileges
of the Gitanos. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They (the Gipsies) were
not to teach the language to any but those who, by birth or
<i>inauguration</i>, belonged to that sect.&#8221; And he gives a
case in point, in the bookseller of Logrono, who was married
to the only daughter of a Gitano count; upon whose
death, the daughter and son-in-law succeeded to the authority
which he had exercised in the tribe. If the Gipsies in
Spain were not mixed in point of blood, why should they
have taken Mr. Borrow for a Gipsy, as he said they did?
The persecutions to which the race in Spain were subjected
were calculated to lead to a mixture of the blood, as in
Scotland, for the reasons given in the <a href="#Page_5">Preface</a>; but, perhaps,
not to the same extent; as the Spanish Acts seem to have
given the tribe an opportunity of escape, under the condition
of settling, &amp;c., &amp;c., which would probably be complied
with, nominally, for the time being; while the face of part
of the country would afford a refuge till the storm had
blown over. (See <a href="#Page_71">pages 71</a> and <a href="#Page_114">114</a>.)</p>

<p>It is very likely that the following people, described by
Paget, in his travels in Central Europe, are mixed Gipsies.
He says: &#8220;In almost every part of the Austrian dominions
are to be found a kind of wandering tinkers, wire-workers,
and menders of crockery, whose language appears to be
that of the Sclaves, who travel about, and, at certain seasons,
return to their own settlements, where the women and
children remain during their absence.&#8221; The wandering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
Rothwelsh, perhaps the same mentioned by Paget, may be
mixed Gipsies. In the Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica they are
spoken of as &#8220;a vagabond people, in the south of Germany,
who have sometimes been confounded with the Gipsies.&#8221;
The <i>appearance</i> of such persons has nothing to do with
their being, or not being, members of Gipsydom.<a name="FNanchor273" id="FNanchor273"></a><a href="#Footnote273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>I will now consider the present condition of the Scottish
Gipsies. But, to commence with, what is the native capacity
of a Gipsy? It is good. Take a common tinkering Gipsy,
without a particle of education, and compare him with a
common native, without a particle of education, and the tinker,
in point of smartness, is worth, perhaps, a dozen of the
other. If not a learned, he is at least a travelled, Athenian,
considerably rubbed up by his intercourse with the world.
This is the proper way by which to judge of the capacity
of a Gipsy. It will differ somewhat according to the countries
and circumstances in which he is found. Grellmann,
about the year 1780, says, of evidently the more original
kind of Hungarian Gipsies: &#8220;Imagine a people of childish
thoughts, whose minds are filled with raw, undigested conceptions,
guided more by sense than reason, and using understanding
and reflection only so far as they promote the
gratification of any particular appetite; and you have a
perfect sketch of the general character of the Gipsies.&#8221;
&#8220;They are lively, uncommonly loquacious, fickle to an extreme;
consequently, inconstant in their pursuits.&#8221; Bischoff,
in speaking of the German Gipsies, in 1827, says: &#8220;They
have a good understanding, an excellent memory, are quick
of comprehension, lively and talkative.&#8221; Mr. Borrow, in
evident allusion to the very lowest, and most ignorant, class
of the Spanish Gipsies, says: &#8220;They seem to hunt for their
bread, as if they were not of the human, but rather of the
animal, species, and, in lieu of reason, were endowed with a
kind of instinct, which assists them to a very limited extent,
and no further.&#8221; I admit that this class of Gipsies
may have as little intellect as there is in an ant-catcher&#8217;s
nose, but the remark can apply to them exclusively.</p>

<p>Without taking into account any opinion expressed by
other writers on the Gipsies, Mr. Borrow says: &#8220;Should it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
be urged that certain individuals have found them very different
from what they are represented in these volumes,
(&#8216;The Gipsies in Spain,&#8217;) he would frankly say that he
yields no credit to the presumed fact.&#8221; And he refers his
readers to his Spanish-Gipsy vocabulary for the words <i>hoax</i>
and <i>hocus</i>, as a reason for such an opinion! He himself
gives descriptions of quite a different caste. For example,
he speaks of a rich Gipsy appearing in a fair, at Leon, in
Spain, with a twenty thousand dollar credit in his pocket.
And of another Gipsy, a native of Constantinople, who had
visited the most remote and remarkable portions of the world,
&#8220;passing over it like a cloud;&#8221; and who spoke several dialects
of the Malay, and understood the original language of
Java. This Gipsy, he says, dealt in precious stones and
poisons; and that there is scarcely a bey or satrap in Persia,
or Turkey, whom he has not supplied with both. In Moscow,
he says, &#8220;There are not a few who inhabit stately
houses, go abroad in elegant equipages, and are behind the
higher orders of the Russians, neither in appearance nor
mental acquirements.&#8221; From these specimens, one might
naturally conclude that there was some room for discrimination
among different classes of Gipsies, instead of rating
them as having the intellect of ant-catchers.</p>

<p>When the Gipsies appeared in Scotland, the natives themselves,
as I have already said, were nearly wholly uneducated.
Many of the Gipsies, then, and long afterwards,
being smart, presumptuous, overbearing, audacious fellows,
seem to have assumed great importance, and been looked
upon as no small people by the authorities and the inhabitants
of the country. In every country in which they have
settled, they seem to have instinctively and very readily
appreciated the ways and spirit of the people, while, at the
same time, they preserved what belonged particularly to
themselves&mdash;their Gipsyism. Gipsydom being, in its very
essence, a &#8220;working in among other people,&#8221; &#8220;a people
within a people,&#8221; it followed, that marriages between adopted
Gipsies, and even Gipsies themselves, and the ordinary natives,
would be encouraged, were it only to contribute to
their existence in the country. The issue of such marriages,
go where they might, would become centres of little Gipsy
circles, which, in their turn, would throw off members that
would become the centres of other little Gipsy circles; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
leaven of Gipsydom leavening into a lump everything that
proceeded out of itself. To such an extent has this been
followed, that, at the present day, the Scottish Gipsies&mdash;at
least the generality of them&mdash;have every outward characteristic
of Scotchmen. But the secret of being Gipsies,
which they carry in their bosoms, makes them appear a little
queer to others; they have a something about them that
makes them look somewhat odd to the other Scotchman, who
is not &#8220;one of them,&#8221; although he does not know the cause
of it.</p>

<p>Upon, or shortly after, their arrival, they seem to have
divided the country among themselves; each tribe exercising
its rights over its own territory, to the exclusion of
others, just as a native lord would have done against other
natives; with a system of passes, regulated by councils of
local or provincial chieftains, and a king, over all. The
Scottish Gipsies, from the very first, seem to have been
thoroughly versed in their vocation, from having had about
a hundred years&#8217; experience, in some other part of Europe,
before they settled in Scotland; although stragglers of their
race evidently had made their appearance in the country
many years before. What might have been the number of
Gipsies then in Scotland, it is impossible to conjecture; it
must have been considerable, if we judge from what is said
in Wraxall&#8217;s History of France, vol. 2, page 32, when, in
reference to the Act of Queen Elizabeth, in 1563, he states,
that, in her reign, the Gipsies throughout England were supposed
to exceed ten thousand. The employments of the
original Gipsies, within their respective districts, seem to
have been what is described under the head of Tweed-dale
and Clydesdale Gipsies; that is, tinkering, making spoons
and other wares, petty trading, telling fortunes, living as
much as possible at free-quarters, dealing in horses, and
visiting fairs. It is extremely likely that those who travelled
Tweed-dale, for example, always averaged about the
same number, down to the time of the American Revolution,
(except in times of civil commotion, when they would have
the country pretty much to themselves,) and were confined
to such of the families of the respective tribes, or the members
of these families, in whom the right was hereditary.
The consequence seems to have been, that perhaps the
younger members of the family had to betake themselves to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
towns and villages, and engage in whatever they could possibly
turn their hands to. Some would, of course, take to
the highway, and kindred fields of industry. Admitting
that the circumstances attending the Gipsies in Scotland, at
that time, and subsequently, were the same, as regards the
manner of making a living, which attend those in England,
at the present day, (with this difference, that they could
more easily roam at large then than now,) and we can have
no difficulty in coming to a conclusion how the surplus of
the tented Gipsy population was disposed of. Among the
English Gipsies of to-day, taking year with year, and tent
with tent, there is, yearly, a continual moving out of the tent;
a kind of Gipsy crop is annually gathered from tented Gipsydom;
and some of these gradually find themselves drawn
into almost every kind of mechanical or manual labour, even
to working in coal-mines and iron-works; others become
peddlers, itinerant auctioneers, and <i>tramps</i> of almost every
imaginable kind; not to speak of those who visit fairs, in
various capacities, or engage in various settled traffic.</p>

<p>Put a Gipsy to any occupation you like, and he shows a
capability and handiness that is astonishing, if he can only
muster up steadiness in his new vocation. But it is difficult
to break him off the tent; he will return, and lounge, for
weeks together, about that of his father, or some other relative.
But get him fairly out of the tent, married, and, in a
degree, settled to some occupation, in a town where there
are not too many of his own race in close proximity to him,
but where he gets mixed up, in his daily avocation, with the
common natives, and he sooner or later falls into the ranks.
Still, his intimate associations are always with Gipsies; for
his ardent attachment to his people, and a corresponding
resentment of the prejudice that exists against it, keep him
aloof from any intimate intercourse with the ordinary inhabitants;
his associations with them hardly ever extending
beyond the commons or the public-house. If he experiences
an attack from his old habits, he will take to the tramp, from
town to town, working at his mechanical occupation; leaving
his wife and children at home. But it is not long before
he returns. His children, having been born and reared in a
town, become habituated to a settled life, like other people.</p>

<p>There is a vast amount of ambition about every Gipsy,
which is displayed, among the humble classes, in all kinds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
of athletic exercises.<a name="FNanchor274" id="FNanchor274"></a><a href="#Footnote274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> The same peculiarity is discernible
among the educated Scottish Gipsies. Carrying about with
them the secret of being Gipsies, which they assume would
be a terrible imputation cast upon them by the ordinary natives,
if they knew of it, they, as it were, fly up, like game-cocks,
and show a disposition to surpass the others in one
way or other; particularly as they consider themselves better
than the common inhabitants. They must always be
&#8220;cock of the company,&#8221; master of ceremonies, or stand at
the top of the tree, if possible. The reader may ask, how
do they consider themselves better than the ordinary natives?
And I answer, that, from having been so long in Scotland,
they are Scotchmen, (as indeed they are, for the most part, in
point of blood,) and consider themselves as good as the
others&mdash;nay, smarter than others in the same sphere, which,
generally speaking, they are; and, in addition to that, being
Gipsies, a great deal better. They pique themselves on
their descent, and on being in possession of secrets which
are peculiarly and exclusively theirs, and which they imagine
no other knows, or will ever know. They feel that
they are part and parcel of those mysterious beings who are
an enigma to others, no less than to themselves. Besides
this vanity, which is peculiar to the Gipsy everywhere, the
Scottish Gipsies have chimed in with all the native Scotch
ideas of clanism, kith, kin, and consequence, as regards
family, descent, and so forth; and applied them so peculiarly
to themselves, as to render their opinion of their body
as something of no small importance. Some of them,
whose descent leads them more directly back to the tented
stock, speak of their families having possessed this district
or the other district of the country, as much, almost, as we
would expect to hear from some native Scottish chieftain.</p>

<p>As regards the various phases of history through which
many of the Scottish Gipsies have passed, we can only form
an estimate from what has been observed in recent times.
The further back, however, we go, the greater were their
facilities to rise to a position in society; for this reason,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
that a very little education, joined to good natural talents,
were all that was necessary, in a mixed Gipsy, to raise
himself in the world, at the time to which I allude. He
could leave the district in which, when a youth, he had
travelled, with his parents; settle in a town where he
was not personally known; commence some traffic, and,
by his industry, gradually raise himself up, and acquire
wealth. He would not lack a proper degree of innate manners,
or personal dignity, to deport himself with propriety
in any ordinary company into which he might enter. Even
at the present day, in Scotland, a poor Gipsy will commence
life with a wheelbarrow, then get a donkey-cart, and, in a
few years, have a very respectable crockery-shop. I am intimate
with an English mixed Gipsy family, the father of
which commenced life as a basket-maker, was afterwards a
constable, and now occasionally travels with the tent. His
son is an M. D., for I have seen his diploma; and is a smart,
intelligent fellow, and quite an adept at chemistry. To
illustrate the change that has taken place among some of the
Scottish Gipsies, within the last fifty years, I may mention
that the grand-children of a prominent Gipsy, mentioned in
<a href="#Page_140">chapter V.</a>, follow, at the present day, the medical, the legal,
and the mercantile professions. Such occurrences have been
frequent in Scotland. There are the cases mentioned by our
author; such as one of the Faas rising to such eminence in
the mercantile world, at Dunbar; and another who rose to
the rank of lieutenant in the East India Company&#8217;s service;
and the Baillie family, which furnished a captain and a
quarter-master to the army, and a country surgeon. These
are but instances of many others, if they were but known.
Some may object, that these were not full-blood Gipsies.
That, I readily admit. But the objection is more nominal
than real. &#8216;If a white were to proceed to the interior of
the American continent, and cast his lot with a tribe of
Indians, his children would, of course, be expected to be
superior, in some respects, to the children of the native
blood exclusively, owing to what the father might be supposed
to teach them. But it is different in the case of a
white marrying a Scottish Gipsy woman, born and reared in
the same community with himself; for the white, in general
cases, brings only his blood, which enables the children, if
they take after himself, in appearance, to enter such places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
as the black Gipsies would not enter, or might not be
allowed to enter. The white father, in such a case, might
not even be so intelligent as the Gipsy mother. Be that as
it may, the individuals to whom I have alluded were nothing
but Gipsies; possibly they did not know when, or through
whom, the white blood was introduced among them; they
knew, at least, that they were Gipsies, and that the links
which connected them with the past were substantially
Gipsy links. Besides the Scottish Gipsies rising to respectable
positions in life, by their own exertions, I can well believe
that Gipsydom has been well brought up through the
female line; especially at a time when females, and particularly
country females, were rude and all but uneducated.
Who more capable of doing that than the lady Baillies, of
Tweed-dale, and the lady Wilsons, of Stirlingshire? Such
Gipsy girls could &#8220;turn natives round their little fingers&#8221;
and act, in a way, the lady at once; &#8220;turn over a new leaf,&#8221;
and &#8220;pin it down;&#8221; and conduct themselves with great
propriety.</p>

<p>Upon a superior Scottish Gipsy settling in a town, and
especially a small town, and wishing to appear respectable,
he would naturally take a pew in the church, and attend
public worship, were it only, as our author asserts, to hide
the fact of his being a Gipsy. Because, among the Scotch,
there is that prying inquisitiveness into their neighbours&#8217;
affairs, that compels a person to be very circumspect, in all
his actions, movements, and expressions, if he wishes to be
thought anything of, at all. The habit of attending church
would then become as regular, in the Gipsy&#8217;s family, as in
the families of the ordinary natives, and, in a great measure,
proceed from as legitimate a motive. The family would be
very polite, indeed, extra polite, to their neighbours. After
they had lulled to sleep every suspicion of what they were,
or, by their really good conduct, had, according to the
popular idea, &#8220;ceased to be Gipsies,&#8221; they would naturally
encourage a formal acquaintance with respectable (and
nothing but respectable,) people in the place. The Gipsy
himself, a really good fellow at heart, honourable in his
dealings, but fond of a bargain, when he could drive a bargain,
and, moreover, a jovial fellow, would naturally make
plenty of business and out-door friends, at least. Rising in
circumstances and the public esteem, he makes up his mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
that his children ought to be something better than himself,
at all events; in short, that they ought not to be behind
those of his respectable neighbours. Some of them he,
therefore, educates for a liberal profession. The Gipsy
himself becomes more and more ambitious: besides attending
church, he must become an elder of the church; or it
may be that the grace of God takes hold of him, and brings
him into the fold. He and his wife conduct themselves
with much propriety; but some of the boys are rather wild;
the girls, however, behave well. Altogether, the whole
family is very much thought of. Such is a Scottish Gipsy
family, (the parents of which are now dead,) that I have in
my mind at the present moment. No suspicion existed in
regard to the father, but there was a breath of suspicion in
regard to the mother. But what difference did that make?
What knowledge had the public of the nature of Gipsydom?</p>

<p>Consider, then, that the process which I have attempted
to describe has been going on, more or less, for at least the
last three hundred and fifty years; and I may well ask,
where might we <i>not</i> expect to meet with Gipsies, in Scotland,
at the present day? And I reply, that we will meet with
them in every sphere of Scottish life, not excepting, perhaps,
the very highest. There are Gipsies among the very best
Edinburgh families. I am well acquainted with Scotchmen,
youths and men of middle age, of education and character,
and who follow very respectable occupations, that are
Gipsies, and who admit that they are Gipsies. But, apart
from my own knowledge, I ask, is it not a fact, that, a few
years ago, a pillar of the Scottish church, at Edinburgh,
upon the occasion of founding a society for the reformation
of the poor class of Scottish Gipsies, and frequently thereafter,
said that he himself was a Gipsy? I ask, again, is not
that a fact? It is a fact. And such a man! Such prayers!
Such deep-toned, sonorous piety! Such candour! Such
judgment! Such amiability of manners! How much respected!
How worthy of respect! The good, the godly,
the saintly doctor! When will we meet his like again?<a name="FNanchor275" id="FNanchor275"></a><a href="#Footnote275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>This leads me to speak of a high-class Scottish Gipsy
family&mdash;the Falls, who settled at Dunbar, as merchants, alluded
to under the chapter on <a href="#Page_236">Border Gipsies</a>.<a name="FNanchor276" id="FNanchor276"></a><a href="#Footnote276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> Who can
doubt that they were Gipsies to the last? How could they
avoid being Gipsies? The Gipsies were their people; their
blood was Gipsy blood. How could they get rid of their
blood and descent? Could they throw either off, as they
would an old coat? Could medical science rid them of
either? Assuredly not. They admitted their descent, <i>over
their cups</i>. But being <i>descendants of Gipsies</i>, and yet <i>not
Gipsies</i>, is a contradiction in terms. The principles which
regulate the descent of other Gipsy families applied equally
to theirs. The fact that Mrs. Fall had the history of her
people, in the act of leaving Yetholm, represented in tapestry,
may be taken as but a straw that indicated how the
wind blew. Was not old Will Faa, the Gipsy king, down
to his death, at the end of the first American war, admitted
to their hospitality as a relative? And do not the Scottish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
Gipsies, at the present day, claim them to have been Gipsies?
Why might not the Falls glory in being Egyptians
among themselves, but not to others? Were not their ancestors
<i>kings</i>? &#8220;Wee kings,&#8221; no doubt, but still kings;
one of them being the &#8220;loved John Faw,&#8221; of James V., whom
all the tribe consider as a great man, (which, doubtless, he
was, in that barbarous age,) and the principal of the thirteen
patriarchs of Scottish Gipsydom. Was not a Gipsy king,
(themselves being Gipsies,) an ancestor of far more respect,
in their eyes, than the founder of a native family, in their
neighbourhood; who, in the reign of Charles II., was a common
country <i>snip</i>, and most likely commenced life with
&#8220;whipping the cat&#8221; around the country, for fivepence a
day, and victuals and clippings?<a name="FNanchor277" id="FNanchor277"></a><a href="#Footnote277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<p>The truth of the matter is, these Falls must have considered
themselves a world better than other people, merely
on account of their being Gipsies, as all Gipsies do, arising,
in part, from that antagonistic spirit of opposition which the
prejudice of their fellow-creatures is so much calculated to
stir up in their minds. Saying, over their cups, that they
were descended from the Faws, the historical Gipsy name
in Scotland, did not divulge very much to the public. For
what idea had the public of the <i>working of Gipsydom</i>&mdash;what
idea of the Gipsy language? Did the public know of
the existence of a Gipsy language in Scotland? In all probability,
it generally did not. If the public heard a Tinkler
use a strange word, all that it would think of it would be,
that it was <i>cant</i>, confined to vagabonds strolling the country.
Would it ever dream that what the vagabonds used
was carefully preserved and spoken among the great
Falls, of Dunbar, within the sanctity of their own dwellings,
as it assuredly must have been? Would the public believe
in such a thing, if even its own ears were made the witnesses
to it? Was the love which the Falls had for their Yetholm
connexion confined to a mere group of their ancestors
worked in tapestry? Where was the Gipsy language, during
all this time? Assuredly it was well preserved in their
family. If it showed the least symptoms of falling off, how
easily could the mothers bring into the family, as servants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
other Gipsies, who would teach it to the children! For, besides
the dazzling hold which the Gipsy language takes of
the mind of a Gipsy, as the language of those black, mysterious
heroes from whom he is descended, the keeping of it
up forms the foundation of that self-respect which a Gipsy
has for himself, amidst the prejudice of the world; from
which, at the bottom of his heart, whatever his position in
life, or character, or associations, may be, he considers himself
separated. I am decidedly of opinion that all the domestics
about this Fall family were Gipsies of one caste,
colour, condition, or what not.</p>

<p>Then, we are told that Miss Fall, who married Sir John
Anstruther, of Elie, baronet, was looked down upon by her
husband&#8217;s friends, and received no other name than Jenny
Faa; and that she was indirectly twitted with being a
Gipsy, by the rabble, while attending an election in which
Sir John was a candidate. What real satisfaction could Jenny,
or any other Gipsy, have for ordinary natives of the country,
when she was conscious of being what she was, and how
she was spoken of, by her husband&#8217;s relatives and the public
generally? She would take comfort in telling her &#8220;wonderful
story&#8221; to her children, (for I presume she would have
children,) who would sympathize with her; and in conversing
with such of her own race as were near her, were it
only her trusty domestics. It is the Gipsy woman who feels
the prejudice that exists towards her race the most acutely;
for she has the rearing of the children, and broods more
over the history of her people. As the needle turns to the
pole, so does the mind of the Gipsy woman to Gipsydom.</p>

<p>We are likewise told that this eminent Gipsy family were
connected, by marriage, with the Footies, of Balgonie; the
Coutts, afterwards bankers; Collector Whyte, of Kirkaldy,
and Collector Melville, of Dunbar. We may assume, as a
mathematical certainty, that Gipsydom, in a refined form, is
in existence in the descendants of these families, particularly
in such of them as were connected with this Gipsy
family by the female side.<a name="FNanchor278" id="FNanchor278"></a><a href="#Footnote278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>A person who has never considered this subject, or any
other cognate to it, may imagine that a Gipsy reproaches
himself with his own blood. Pshaw! Where will you
find a man, or a tribe of men, under the heavens, that will
do that? It is not in human nature to do it. All men
venerate their ancestors, whoever they have been. A Gipsy
is, to an extraordinary degree, proud of his blood. &#8220;I have
very little of the blood, myself,&#8221; said one of them, &#8220;but just
come and see my wife!&#8221; But people may say that the ancestors
of the Falls were thieves. And were not all the
Borderers, in their way, the worst kind of thieves? They
might not have stolen from their nearest relatives; but, with
that exception, did they not steal from each other? Now,
Gipsies never, or hardly ever, steal from each other. Were
not all the Elliots and Armstrongs thieves of the first
water? Were not the Scotts and the Kers thieves, long
after the Gipsies entered Scotland? When the servants of
Scott of Harden drove out his last cow, and said, &#8220;There goes
Harden&#8217;s cow,&#8221; did not the old cow-stealer say, &#8220;It will soon
be Harden&#8217;s <i>kye</i>&#8220;&mdash;meaning, that he would set out on a cow-stealing
expedition? In fact, he lived upon spoil. Was it
not his lady&#8217;s custom, on the last bullock being killed, to
place on the table a dish, which, on being uncovered, was
found to contain a pair of clean spurs&mdash;a hint, to her husband
and his followers, that they must shift for their next
meal? The descendants of these Scotts, and the Scottish
public generally, look, with the utmost complacency and
pride, upon the history of such families; yet would be very
apt to make a great ado, if the ancestress of a Gipsy should,
in such a predicament, have hung out a cock&#8217;s tail at the
mouth of her tent, as a hint to her &#8220;laddies&#8221; to look after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
poultry. Common sense tells us, that, for one excuse to be
offered for such conduct, on the part of the <i>landed-gentry</i>
of the country, a hundred can be found for the ancestor of a
Gipsy&mdash;an unfortunate wanderer on the face of the earth,
who was hunted about, like a wolf of the forest.<a name="FNanchor279" id="FNanchor279"></a><a href="#Footnote279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>And what shall we say of our Highland thieves? Highlanders
may be more touchy on this point, for their ancestors
were the last of the British race to give up that kind of
life. Talk of the laws passed against the Gipsies! Various
of our Scottish monarchs issued decrees against &#8220;the
wicked thieves and limmers of the clans and surnames, inhabiting
the Highlands and Isles,&#8221; accusing &#8220;the chieftains
principal of the branches worthy to be esteemed the very
authors, fosterers, and maintainers, of the wicked deeds of
the vagabonds of their clans and surnames.&#8221; Indeed, the
doweries of the chiefs&#8217; daughters were made up by a share
of the booty collected on their expeditions. The Highlands
were, at one time, little better than a nest of thieves;
thieving from each other, and more particularly from their
southern neighbours. It is notorious that robbery, in the
Highlands, was &#8220;held to be a calling not merely innocent,
but honourable;&#8221; and that a high-born Highland warrior
was &#8220;much more becomingly employed, in plundering the
lands of others, than in tilling his own.&#8221; At stated times of
the year, such as at Candlemas, regular bands of Highlanders,
the sons of gentlemen and what not, proceeded south
in quest of booty, as part of their winter&#8217;s provisions. The
Highlanders might even have been compared, at one time, to
as many tribes of Afghans. Mr. Skene, the historian of the
Highlands, and himself a Highlander, says that the Highlanders
believed that they <i>had a right</i> to plunder the people
of the low country, <i>whenever it was in their power</i>. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
naturally ask, how did the Highlanders <i>acquire</i> this right of
plunder? Were they ever proscribed? Were any of them
hung, merely for being Highlanders? No. What plea,
then, did the Highlanders set up, in justification of this
wholesale robbery?&mdash;&#8220;They believed, <i>from tradition</i>, that
the Lowlands, <i>in old times</i>, were the possessions of their ancestors.&#8221;
(<i>Skene.</i>) But that was no excuse for their plundering
each other.<a name="FNanchor280" id="FNanchor280"></a><a href="#Footnote280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>The Gipsy&#8217;s ordinary pilfering was confined to such petty
things as &#8220;hens and peats at pleasure,&#8221; &#8220;cutting a bit lamb&#8217;s
throat,&#8221; and &#8220;a mouthfu&#8217; o&#8217; grass and a pickle corn, for the
cuddy&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;things that a farmer body ne&#8217;er could miss.&#8221; But
your Highlanders did not content themselves with such
&#8220;needles and pins;&#8221; they must have &#8220;horned cattle.&#8221; If
the coast was clear, they would table their drawn dirks,
and commence their <i>spulzie</i>, by making their victims furnish
them with what was necessary to fill their bellies; upon the
strength of which, they would &#8220;lift&#8221; whatever they could
carry and drive, or take its equivalent in black-mail.</p>

<p>What an effort is made by our McGregors, at the present
day, to scrape up kin with this or the other bandit McGregor;
and yet how apt the McGregor is to turn up his
nose&mdash;just as Punch, only, could make him turn it up&mdash;if a
Gipsy were to step out, and say, that he was a descendant,
and could speak the language, of Will Baillie, mentioned
under the head of Tweed-dale and Clydesdale Gipsies: a
Gipsy, described by my ancestor, (and he could judge,) to
have been &#8220;the handsomest, the best dressed, the best looking,
and the best bred, man he ever saw; and the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
swordsman in Scotland, for, with his weapon in his hand,
and his back at a wall, he could set almost everything, saving
fire-arms, at defiance; a man who could act the gentleman,
the robber, the sorner, and the tinker, whenever it
answered his purpose.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor281" id="FNanchor281"></a><a href="#Footnote281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> And yet, some of this man&#8217;s descendants
will doubtless be found among our medical doctors,
and even the clergy. I recollect our author pointing
out a clergyman of the Scottish Church, who, he was pretty
sure, was &#8220;one of them.&#8221; What name could have stood
lower, at one time, than McGregor? Both by legal and
social proscription, it was looked upon as vagabond; and
doubtless the clan brought it, primarily and principally, upon
themselves; but as for the rapine they practised upon their
neighbours, and the helpless southerners, they were, at first,
no worse, in that respect, than others of their nation. Are
the McGregors sure that there are no Gipsies among them?
There are plenty of Gipsies of, at least, the name of McGregor,
known to both the Scottish and English Gipsies.
What more likely than some of the McGregors, when &#8220;out,&#8221;
and leading their vagabond lives, getting mixed up with the
better kind of mixed Gipsies? They were both leading a
wild life, and it is not unlikely that some of the McGregors,
of even no small consequence, might have been led captive
by such Gipsy girls as the lady Baillies, of Tweed-dale. Let
a Gipsy once be grafted upon a native family, and she rises
with it; leavens the little circle of which she is the centre,
and leaves it, and its descendants, for all time coming,
Gipsies.</p>

<p>I now come to ask, what constitutes a Gipsy at the present
day? And common sense replies: the simple fact of knowing
from whom he is descended, that is, who he is, in connection
with having the Gipsy words and signs, although
these are not absolutely necessary. It requires no argument
to show that there is no tribe or nation but finds something
that leads it to cling to its origin and descent, and not despise
the blood that runs in its own veins, although it may
despise the condition or conduct of some of its members.
Where shall we find an exception to this rule? The Gipsy
race is no exception to it. Civilize a Gipsy, and you make
him a civilized Gipsy; educate him, and you make him an
educated Gipsy; bring him up to any profession you like,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
Christianize him as much as you may, and he still remains a
Gipsy; because he is of the Gipsy race, and all the influences
of nature and revelation do not affect the questions
of blood, tribe, and nationality. Take all the Gipsies that
ever came out of the tent, or their descendants, including
those brought into the body through the male and female
line; and what are they now? Still Gipsies. They even
pass into the other world Gipsies. &#8220;But they will forget
that they are Gipsies,&#8221; say, perhaps, some of my readers.
Forget that they are Gipsies! Will we hear, some of these
days, that Scotch people, themselves, will get up of a morning,
toss about their night-caps, and forget that they are
Scotch? We may then see the same happen with the Gipsies.
What I have said, of the Gipsy always being a Gipsy,
is self-evident; but it has a wide difference of meaning
from that contained in the quotation given by Mr. Borrow,
in which it is said: &#8220;For that which is unclean by nature
thou canst entertain no hope; no washing will turn the
Gipsy white.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor282" id="FNanchor282"></a><a href="#Footnote282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> But, taking the world all over, there will
doubtless be Gipsies, in larger or smaller numbers, who will
always be found following the original ways of their race.</p>

<p>What were the Hungarians, at one time, and what are
they now? Pritchard says of them: &#8220;The Hungarians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
laid aside the habits of rude and savage hunters, far below
the condition of the nomadic hordes, for the manners of
civilized life. In the course of a thousand years, they have
become a handsome people, of fine stature, regular European
features, and have the complexion prevalent in that tract of
Europe where they dwell.&#8221; Now the Gipsies have been in
Scotland at least three hundred and fifty years; and what
with the mixture of native blood, (which, at least, helped to
remove the prejudice against the man&#8217;s appearance, and, consequently,
gave him a larger and freer scope of action;) the
hard laws of necessity, and the being tossed about by society,
like pebbles on the seashore; the influences of civilization,
education, and the grace of God itself; by such means as
these, some of the Scottish Gipsies have risen to a respectable,
even eminent, position in life. But some people may
say: &#8220;These are not Gipsies; they have little of the blood
in them.&#8221; That is nothing. Ask themselves what they are,
and, if they are at all candid, they will reply that they are
Gipsies. &#8220;No doubt,&#8221; they say, &#8220;we have fair, or red, or
black, hair, (as the case may be;) we know nothing about
that; but we know that we <i>are</i> Gipsies; that is all.&#8221; There
is as much difference between such a high-class Gipsy and a
poor Gipsian, as there is between a Scottish judge and the
judge&#8217;s fourth cousin, who makes his living by clipping dogs&#8217;
ears. The principle of progression, the passing through one
phase of history into another, while the race maintains its
identity, holds good with the Gipsies, as well as with any
other people.</p>

<p>Take a Gipsy in his original state, and we can find nothing
really <i>vulgar</i> about him. What is popularly understood
to be Gipsy life may be considered low life, by people who
do not overmuch discriminate in such matters; but view it
after its kind, and it is not really low; for a Gipsy is naturally
polite and well mannered. He does not consider himself
as belonging to the same race as the native, and would
rather be judged by a different standard. The life which
he leads is not that of the lowest class of the country in
which he dwells, but the primitive, original state of a people
of great antiquity, proscribed by law and society; himself
an enemy of, and an enemy to, all around him; with the
population so prejudiced against him, that attempts to change
his condition, consistently with his feelings as a man, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
frequently rendered in vain: so that, on the ground of
strict morals, or even administrative justice, the man can be
said to be only half responsible. The subject, however,
assumes quite a different aspect, when we consider a Gipsy
of education and refinement, like the worthy clergyman
mentioned, between whose condition and that of his tented
ancestor an interval of, perhaps, two or three centuries has
elapsed. We should then put him on the footing of any
other race having a barbarous origin, and entertain no prejudice
against him on account of the race to which he belongs.
He is then to be judged as we judge Highland and
Border Scots, for the whole three were at one time robbers;
and all the three having welled up to respectable life together,
they ought to be judged on their merits, individually,
as men, and treated accordingly. And the Gipsy ought to
be the most leniently dealt with, on the principle that the
actions of his ancestors were far more excusable, and even
less heinous, than those of the others. And as regards antiquity
of descent, the Gipsy&#8217;s infinitely surpasses the others,
being probably no less than the shepherd kings, part of
whose blood left Egypt, in the train of the Jews. I would
place such a Gipsy on the footing of the Hungarian race;
with this difference, that the Hungarians entered Europe in
the ninth century, and became a people, occupying a territory;
while the Gipsies appeared in the fifteenth century,
and are now to be found, civilized and uncivilized, in almost
every corner of the known world.</p>

<p>The admission of the good man alluded to casts a flood
of light upon the history of the Scottish Gipsy race,
shrouded as it is from the eye of the general population;
but the information given by him was apt to fall flat upon
the ear of the ordinary native, unless it was accompanied by
some such exposition of the subject as is given in this work.
Still, we can gather from it, where Gipsies are to be found,
what <i>a</i> Scottish Gipsy is, and what the race is capable of;
and what might be expected of it, if the prejudice of their
fellow-creatures was withdrawn from the race, as distinguished
from the various classes into which it may be divided,
or, I should rather say, the personal conduct of each Gipsy
individually. View the subject any way I may, I cannot
resist coming to the conclusion that, under more favourable
circumstances, it is difficult to say what the Gipsies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
might not attain to. But that would depend greatly upon
the country in which they are to be found. Scotland has
been peculiarly favourable for them, in some respects.</p>

<p>As regards the Scottish Gipsy population, at the present
day, I can only adopt the language of the immortal Dominie
Sampson, and say, that it must be &#8220;prodigious.&#8221; If we consider
the number that appear to have settled in Scotland,
the length of time they have been in Scotland, the great
amount of white blood that has, by one means or other, been
brought into, and mixed up with, the body, and its great
natural encrease; the feelings that attach them to their descent&mdash;feelings
that originate, more properly, within themselves,
and feelings that press upon them from without&mdash;the
various occupations and positions in life in which they are
to be found; we cannot set any limit to their number.
Gipsies are just like other people; they have their own sets
or circles of associates, out of which, as a thing that is
almost invariable, they will hide, if not deny, themselves to
others of their race, for reasons which have already been
given. So almost invariable is this, at the present day,
amongst Gipsies that are not tented Gipsies, that, should an
English Gipsy come across a settlement of them in America&mdash;German
Gipsies, for example&mdash;and cast his sign, and address
them in their own speech, they will pretend not to
know what he means, although he sees the Gipsy in their
faces and about their dwellings. But should he meet with
them away from their homes, and where they are not known,
they would answer, and be cheek-by-jowl with him, in a moment.
I have found, by personal experience, that the same
holds with the French and other continental Gipsies in
America.<a name="FNanchor283" id="FNanchor283"></a><a href="#Footnote283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> It is particularly so with the Scottish Gipsies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
For these reasons, it seems to be beyond question that the
number at which our author estimates them in Scotland, viz.,
5,000, must be vastly below the real number. If I were to
say 100,000, I do not think I would over-estimate them.
The opinion of the Gipsies whom our author questioned
was a guess, so far as it referred to the class to which they
belonged, or with which they were acquainted; so that, if
we take all kinds of Gipsies into account, it would be a very
moderate estimate to set the Scottish Gipsies down at
100,000; and those in all the British Isles at 300,000. The
number might be double what I have stated. The intelligent
English Gipsies say that, in England, they are not only
&#8220;dreadfully mixed,&#8221; but extremely numerous. There is not
a race of men on the face of the earth more prolific than
tented Gipsies; in a word, tented Gipsydom, if I may hazard
such an expression, is, comparatively speaking, like a rabbit
warren. The rough and uncouth kind of settled Gipsies are
likewise very prolific; but the higher classes, as a rule, are
by no means so much so. To set down any specific number
of Gipsies to be found in the British Isles, would be a thing
too arbitrary to serve any purpose; I think sufficient data
have been given to enable the intelligent reader to form an
opinion for himself.<a name="FNanchor284" id="FNanchor284"></a><a href="#Footnote284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>That many Gipsies were banished to America, in colonial
times, from England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, sometimes
for merely being &#8220;by habit and repute Gipsies,&#8221; is
beyond dispute. &#8220;Your Welsh and Irish,&#8221; said an English
Gipsy, in the United States, &#8220;were so mean, when they
banished a Gipsy to the Plantations, as to make him find
his own passage; but the English always paid the Gipsy&#8217;s
passage for him.&#8221; The Scotch seem also to have made the
Gipsy find his own passage, and failing that, to have hanged
him. It greatly interests the English Gipsies arriving in
America, to know about the native American Gipsies. I
have been frequently in the company of an English Gipsy,
in America, whose great-grandfather was so banished; but
he did not relish the subject being spoken of. Gipsies may
be said to have been in America almost from the time of its
settlement. We have already seen how many of them found
their way there, during the Revolution, by being impressed
as soldiers, and taken as volunteers, for the benefit of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
bounty and passage; and how they deserted on landing.
Tented Gipsies have been seen about Baltimore for the last
seventy years. In New England, a colony is known which
has existed for about a hundred years, and has always been
looked upon with a singular feeling of distrust and mystery
by the inhabitants, who are the descendants of the early
emigrants, and who did not suspect their origin till lately.
These Gipsies have never associated, in the common sense
of the word, with the other settlers, and, judging from their
exterior, seem poor and miserable, whatever their circumstances
may be. They follow pretty much the employment
and modes of life of the same class in Europe; the most
striking feature being, that the bulk of them leave the homestead
for a length of time, scatter in different directions,
and reunite, periodically, at their quarters, which are left
in charge of some of the feeble members of the band.</p>

<p>It is not likely that many of the colonial Gipsies would
take to the tent; for, arriving, for the most part, as individuals,
separated from family relations, they were more apt
to follow settled, semi-settled, or general itinerant occupations;
and the more so, as the face of the country, and the
thin and scattered settlements, would hardly admit of it.
They were apt to squat on wild or unoccupied lands, in the
neighbourhood of towns and settlements, like their brethren
in Europe, when they took up their quarters on the borders
of well-settled districts, with a wild country to fall back on,
in times of danger or prosecution by the lawful authorities.
Besides disposing of themselves, to some little extent,
in this way, many of the Gipsies, banished, or going to the
colonies of their own accord, would betake themselves to the
various occupations common to the ordinary emigrants; the
more especially as, when they arrived, they would find a field<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
in which they were not known to be Gipsies; which would
give them greater scope and confidence, and enable them to
go anywhere, or enter upon any employment, where, not
being known to be Gipsies, they would meet with no prejudice
to contend with. Indeed, a new country, in which the
people had, more or less, to be, in a sense, tinkers, that is,
jacks-of-all-trades, and masters of none, was just the sphere
of a handy Gipsy, who could &#8220;do a&#8217; most of things.&#8221; They
would turn to the tinkering, peddling, horse-dealing, tavern-keeping,
and almost all the ordinary mechanical trades, and,
among others, broom-making. Perhaps the foundation of
the American broom manufacture was laid by the British
Gipsies, by whom it may be partly carried on at the present
day; a business they pretty much monopolize, in a rough
way, in Great Britain. We will doubtless find, among the
fraternity, some of those whittling, meddling Sam Slick peddlers,
so often described: I have seen some of those itinerant
venders of knife-sharpeners, and such &#8220;Yankee notions,&#8221;
with dark, glistening eyes, that would &#8220;pass for the article.&#8221;
Some of them would live by less legitimate business. I entertain
no doubt, what from the general fitness of things,
and the appearance of some of the men, that we will find
some of the descendants of the old British mixed Gipsies
members of the various establishments of Messrs. Peter
Funks and Company,<a name="FNanchor285" id="FNanchor285"></a><a href="#Footnote285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> of the city of New York, as well as
elsewhere. And I entertain as little doubt that many of
those American women who tell fortunes, and engage in
those many curious bits of business that so often come up
at trials, are descendants of the British plantation stock of
Gipsies. But there are doubtless many of these Gipsies in
respectable spheres of life. It would be extremely unreasonable
to say that the descendants of the colonial Gipsies
do not still exist as Gipsies, like their brethren in Great
Britain, and other parts of the Old World. The English
Gipsies in America entertain no doubt of it; the more especially
as they have encountered such Gipsies, of at least
two descents. I have myself met with such a Gipsy, following
a decidedly respectable calling, whom I found as much
one of the tribe, barring the original habits, as perhaps any
one in Europe.</p>

<p>There are many Hungarian and German Gipsies in America;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
some of them long settled in Pennsylvania and Maryland,
where they own farms. Some of them leave their
farms in charge of hired hands, during the summer, and proceed
South with their tents. In the State of Pennsylvania,
there is a settlement of them, on the J&mdash;&mdash; river, a little
way above H&mdash;&mdash;, where they have saw-mills. About the
Alleghany Mountains, there are many of the tribe, following
somewhat the original ways of the race. In the United
States generally, there are many Gipsy peddlers, British as
well as continental. There are a good many Gipsies in
New York&mdash;English, Irish, and continental&mdash;some of whom
keep tin, crockery, and basket stores; but these are all
mixed Gipsies, and many of them of fair complexion. The
tin-ware which they make is generally of a plain, coarse
kind; so much so, that a Gipsy tin store is easily known.
They frequently exhibit their tin-ware and baskets on the
streets, and carry them about the city. Almost all, if not
all, of those itinerant cutlers and tinkers, to be met with in
New York, and other American cities, are Gipsies, principally
German, Hungarian, and French. There are a good
many Gipsy musicians in America. &#8220;What!&#8221; said I, to an
English Gipsy, &#8220;those organ-grinders?&#8221; &#8220;Nothing so low as
that. Gipsies don&#8217;t <i>grind</i> their music, sir; they <i>make</i> it.&#8221;
But I found in his house, when occupied by other Gipsies, a
<i>hurdy-gurdy</i> and tambourine; so that Gipsies sometimes
<i>grind</i> music, as well as <i>make</i> it. I know of a Hungarian
Gipsy who is leader of a Negro musical band, in the city of
New York; his brother drives one of the Avenue cars.
There are a number of Gipsy musicians in Baltimore, who
play at parties, and on other occasions. Some of the fortune-telling
Gipsy women about New York will make as
much as forty dollars a week in that line of business. They
generally live a little way out of the city, into which they
ride, in the morning, to their places of business. I know of
one, who resides in New Jersey, opposite New York, and
who has a place in the city, to which ladies, that is, females
of the highest classes, address their cards, for her to call
upon them. When she gets a chance of a young fellow with
his female friend, she &#8220;puts the screws on;&#8221; for she knows
well that he dare not &#8220;back out;&#8221; so she frequently manages
to squeeze five dollars out of him.</p>

<p>Many hundred, perhaps several thousand, of English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
tented, and partly tented Gipsies, have arrived in America
within the last ten years. They, for the most part, travel,
and have travelled every State in the Union, east of the
Rocky Mountains, as well as the British Provinces, as horse-dealers,
peddlers, doctors, exhibitors, fortune-tellers, and
<i>tramps</i> generally. Such English Gipsies, above all men in
America, may, with the greatest propriety, say,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;No pent-up Utica contracts our powers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the whole boundless continent is ours.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The fortune-tellers, every time they set out on their peregrinations,
choose a new route; for they say it is more difficult
to go over the same ground in America, than it is in England.
The horse-dealers say that Jonathan is a good judge
of a horse; that sometimes they get the advantage of him,
and sometimes he of them; but that his demand for a warranty
sometimes bothers them a deal. &#8220;What then?&#8221; I asked.
&#8220;Well, we give him a warranty; and should the beast <i>happen</i>
to turn out wrong, let him catch us if he can!&#8221; It is
really astonishing how sensibly these English Gipsies talk
of American affairs generally; they are very discriminating
in their remarks, and wonderfully observant of places and
localities. They do not like the Negroes. In their society
they drop the name of king, and adopt that of president.
&#8220;Cunning fellows,&#8221; said I, &#8220;to eschew the name of king,
and look down upon Negroes. That will do, in
America!&#8221;</p>

<p>I have found the above kind of Gipsies, in America, to be
generally pretty well off; they all seem to flourish, and
have plenty of money about them. The fortune-telling, horse-dealing,
and peddling branches of them have a fine field for
following their respective businesses. America, indeed, is a
&#8220;great country&#8221; for the Gipsies; for it contains &#8220;no end&#8221;
of chickens, to say nothing of ducks, geese, and turkeys,
many of which are carried off by <i>varmint</i>, anyhow. There,
they will find, for some time, many opportunities of gathering
rich harvests, among what has been termed the shrewdest,
but, in some things, the most gullible, of mortals, as an
instance may illustrate. A Gipsy woman, known as such,
drags, into the meshes of her necromancy, &#8216;cute Jonathan;
who, with an infinite reliance on his own smartness, to &#8220;try
the skill of the critter,&#8221; by her directions, ties up, in gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
and paper, something like a thousand dollars, and, after she
has passed her hands over it, and muttered a few cabalistic
words, deposits it in his strong box. She sets a day, on
which she calls, handles the &#8220;dimes,&#8221; while muttering some
more expressions, rather accidentally drops them, then returns
them to the box, and sets another day when she will
call, and add much to his wealth. She does not appear,
however, on the day mentioned. Our simpleton gets first
anxious, then excited, then suspicious, then examines his
&#8220;pile,&#8221; and finds it transformed into a lot of copper and old
paper! For, in dropping the parcel, Meg does it adroitly
about the folds of her dress, quickly substitutes another, exactly
alike, and makes off with the fruits of her labour.
Then come the hue and cry, telegraphing, and dispatching
of warrants everywhere. But why need he trouble himself?
So, after a harder day&#8217;s work than, perhaps, he ever underwent
in his life, he returns home: but knowing the sympathy
he will find there, he puts on his best face, and, to
have the first word of it, (for he is not to be laughed at,)
wipes his forehead, twitches his mouth, winks his eyes, and
remarks: &#8220;Waal, I reckon I&#8217;ve been most darnedly sold, anyhow!&#8221;
Such occurrences are very common among almost
all classes of rural Americans. Sometimes it is to discover
treasure on the individual&#8217;s lands, or in the neighbourhood;
sometimes a mine, and sometimes an Indian, a trapper, a
pirate, or a revolutionary deposit. When the Gipsy escapes
with her spoil, she frequently makes for her home, but
where that is, no one knows. On being molested, while there,
she produces friends, in fair standing, who <i>prove</i> an alibi;
and, with the further assistance of a well-feed lawyer, defies
all the requisitions, made by the governors of neighbouring
States, for her delivery. At other times, she will <i>divide</i>
with the inferior authorities, or surrender the whole of the
plunder; for, to go to jail she will not, if she can help it.<a name="FNanchor286" id="FNanchor286"></a><a href="#Footnote286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>In Virginia, the more original kind of Gipsies are very
frequently to be met with. It is in the Slave States they
are more apt to flourish in the olden form. The planters
need not trouble themselves about their tampering with the
Negroes, for they have no sympathy with them. Were it
otherwise, they would soon be <i>mum</i>, on finding what the results
would be to them. I have given some of them some
useful hints on that score. The general disposition of the
people, the want of <i>learning</i> among so many of them, the distances
between dwellings, the small villages, the handy mechanical
services of the Gipsies, the uncultivated tracts of
land, the game of various kinds, and the climate, seem to
point out some of the Slave States as an elysium for the Gipsies;
unless the wealthier part of the inhabitants should use
the poorer class as tools to drive them out of the country.<a name="FNanchor287" id="FNanchor287"></a><a href="#Footnote287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>There are a good many very respectable Scottish Gipsies
in the United States; but I do not wish to be too minute in
describing them. In Canada, I know of a doctor, a lawyer,
and an editor, Scottish Gipsies. The fact of the matter is,
that, owing to the mixture of the blood, the improvement,
and perpetuation, and secrecy, of the race, there may be
many, very many, Gipsies, in almost every place in the
world, and other people not know of it: and it is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
likely that, at the present time, they will say that they are
Gipsies. Indeed, the intelligent English travelling Gipsies
say that there are an immense number of Gipsies, of all countries,
colours, and occupations, in America.</p>

<p>There is even some resemblance between the formation of
Gipsydom and that of the United States. The children of
emigrants, it is well known, frequently prove the most ultra
Americans. Instead of the original colonists, at the Declaration
of Independence, imagine the commencement of Gipsydom
as proceeding from the original stock of Gipsies.
The addition to their number, from without, differs from
that which takes place among Americans, in this way: that
all such additions to Gipsydom are made in such a manner,
that the new blood gets innoculated, as it were, with the
old, or part of the old; so that it may be said of the whole
body,</p>

<p class="blockquot fsize80"><i>One drop of blood makes all Gipsydom akin.</i></p>

<p>The simple fact of a person having Gipsy blood in his veins,
in addition to the rearing of a Gipsy parent, acts upon him
like a shock of electricity; it makes him spring to his feet,
and&mdash;&#8220;snap his teeth at other dogs!&#8221; A very important
circumstance contributing to this state of things is the antipathy
which mankind have for the very name of Gipsy,
which, as I have already said, they all take to themselves;
insomuch that the better class will not face it. They imagine
that, socially speaking, they are among the damned, and they
naturally cast their lot with the damned. Still, the antagonistic
spirit which would naturally arise towards society,
in the minds of such Gipsies, remains, in a measure, latent;
for they feel confident in their incognito, while moving
among their fellow-creatures; which circumstance robs it of
its sting.</p>

<p>Let a Lowlander, in times that are past, but have cast up
a Highlander&#8217;s blood to him, and what would have been the
consequences? &#8220;Her ainsel would have drawn her dirk, or
whipped out her toasting-iron, and seen which <i>was</i> the prettiest
man.&#8221; Let the same have been done to a Scottish
Gipsy, in comparatively recent times, and he would have
taken his own peculiar revenge. See how the Baillies, as
mentioned under the chapter of <a href="#Page_185">Tweed-dale and Clydesdale
Gipsies</a>, mounted on horseback, and with drawn swords in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
their hands, threatened death to all who opposed them, for
an affront offered to their mother. Twit a respectable
Gipsy with his blood, at the present day, and he would suffer
in silence; for, by getting into a passion, he would let
himself out. For this reason, it would be unmanly to hint
it to him, in any tone of disparagement. The difference of
feeling between the two races, at the present day, proceeds
from positive ignorance on the part of the native towards
the other; an ignorance in which the Gipsy would rather
allow him to remain; for, let him turn himself in whatever
direction he may, he imagines he sees, and perhaps does see,
nothing but a dark mountain of prejudice existing between
him and every other of his fellow-creatures. He would
rather retain his incognito, and allow his race to go down
to posterity shrouded in its present mystery. The history
of the Gipsy race in Scotland, more, perhaps, than in any
other country, shows, to the eye of the world, as few traces
of its existence as would a fox, in passing over a ploughed
field. The farmer might see the foot-prints of reynard, but
how is he to find reynard himself? He must bring out the
dogs and have a hunt for him. As an Indian of the prairie,
while on the &#8220;war path,&#8221; cunningly arranges the long grass
into its natural position, as he passes through it, to prevent
his enemy following him, so has the Scottish Gipsy, as he
entered upon a settled life, destroyed, to the eye of the ordinary
native, every trace of his being a Gipsy. Still, I
cannot doubt but that he has misgivings that, some day, he
will be called up to judgment, and that all about him will
be exposed to the world.</p>

<p>What is it that troubles the educated Gipsies? Nothing
but the word Gipsy; a word which, however sweet when
used among themselves, conveys an ugly, blackguard, and
vagabond meaning to other people. The poet asks, What is
there in a name? and I reply, Everything, as regards the name
Gipsy. For a respectable Scottish Gipsy to say to the public,
that &#8220;his mother is a Gipsy,&#8221; or, that &#8220;his wife is a Gipsy,&#8221; or,
that &#8220;he is a Gipsy;&#8221; such a Gipsy simply could not do it.
These Gipsies will hardly ever use the word among themselves,
except in very select circles; but they will say &#8220;he&#8217;s one of
us;&#8221; &#8220;he&#8217;s from Yetholm;&#8221; &#8220;he&#8217;s from the metropolis,&#8221;
(Yetholm being the metropolis of Scottish Gipsydom;) or, &#8220;he&#8217;s
a traveller.&#8221; If the company is not over classical, they will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
say &#8220;he&#8217;s from the black quarry,&#8221; or, &#8220;he&#8217;s been with the cuddies.&#8221;
Imagine a select party of educated Scottish Gipsies,
all closely related. They will then chatter Gipsy over their
tea; but if a person should drop in, one of the party, who is
not acquainted with him, will nudge and whisper to another,
&#8220;Is he one of the tribe?&#8221; or, &#8220;Is he one of us?&#8221; The better
class of Scottish Gipsies are very exclusive in matters of
this kind.</p>

<p>All things considered, in what other position could the
Gipsy race, in Scotland especially, be, at the present day,
than that described? How can we imagine a race of people
to act otherwise than hide themselves, if they could, from
the odium that attaches to the name of Gipsy? And what
estimate should we place on that charity which would lead
a person to denounce a Gipsy, should he deny himself to be
a Gipsy?<a name="FNanchor288" id="FNanchor288"></a><a href="#Footnote288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> As a race, what can they offer to society at
large to receive them within its circle? They can offer little,
as a race; but, if we consider them as individuals, we
will find many of them whose eduction, character, and position
in life, would warrant their admission into any ordinary
society, and some of them into any society. Notwithstanding
all that, none will answer up to the name of Gipsy.
It necessarily follows, that the race must remain shrouded
in its present mystery, unless some one, not of the race,
should become acquainted with its history, and speak for
it. In Scotland, the prejudice towards the name of Gipsy
might be safely allowed to drop, were it only for this reason:
that the race has got so much mixed up with the native
blood, and even with good families of the country, as to
be, in plain language, a jumble&mdash;a pretty kettle of fish, indeed.
One&#8217;s uncle, in seeking for a wife, might have
stumbled over an Egyptian woman, and, either known or
unknown to himself, had his children brought up bitter
Gipsies; so that one&#8217;s cousins may be Gipsies, for anything
one knows. A man may have a colony of Gipsies in
his own house, and know nothing about it! The Gipsies
<i>died</i> out? Oh, no. They commenced in Scotland by wringing
the necks of one&#8217;s <i>chickens</i>, and now they sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;! But what is Gipsydom, after all, but a
&#8220;working in among other people?&#8221;</p>

<p>In seeking for Gipsies among Scotch people, I know where
to begin, but it puzzles me where to leave off. I would pay
no regard to colour of hair or eyes, character, employment,
position, or, indeed, any outward thing. The reader may say:
&#8220;It must be a difficult matter to detect such mixed and educated
Gipsies as those spoken of.&#8221; It is not only difficult,
but outwardly impossible. Such Gipsies cannot even tell
each other, from their personal appearance; but they have
signs, which they can use, if the others choose to respond to
them. If I go into a company which I have reason to believe
is a Gipsy one, and it know nothing of me, so far as
my pursuit is concerned, I will bring the subject of the Gipsies
up, in a very roundabout way, and mark the effect which
the conversation makes, or the turn it takes. What I know
of the subject, and of the ignorance of mankind generally in
regard to it, enables me to say, in almost every instance,
who they are, let them make any remark they like, look as
they like, pretend what they like, wriggle about as they like,
or keep dead silent. As I gradually glide into the subject,
and expatiate upon the &#8220;greatness of the society,&#8221; one remarks,
&#8220;I know it;&#8221; upon the &#8220;respectability of some of its
members,&#8221; and another emphatically exclaims, &#8220;That&#8217;s a
fact;&#8221; and upon &#8220;its universality,&#8221; and another bawls out,
&#8220;That&#8217;s so.&#8221; Indeed, by finding the Gipsies, under such
circumstances, completely off their guard, (for they do not
doubt their secret being confined to themselves,) I can generally
draw forth, in one way or other, as much moral certainty,
barring their direct admission, as to their being Gipsies,
as a dog, by putting his nose into a hole, can tell
whether a rat is there, or not.</p>

<p>The principle of the transmutation of Gipsy blood into
white, in appearance, is illustrated, in the ninth chapter of Mr.
Borrow&#8217;s &#8220;Bible in Spain,&#8221; by its changing into almost pure
black. A Gipsy soldier, in the Spanish army, killed his
sergeant, for &#8220;calling him <i>calo</i>, (Gipsy,) and cursing him,&#8221; and
made his escape. His wife remained in the army, as a sutler,
selling wine. Two years thereafter, a strange man came
to her wine shop. &#8220;He was dressed like a Moor, (<i>corahano</i>,)
and yet he did not look like one; he looked more like a
black, and yet he was not a black, either, though he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
almost black. And, as I looked upon him, I thought he
looked something like the Errate, (Gipsies,) and he said to
me, &#8216;<i>Zincali, chachip&eacute;</i>,&#8217; (the Gipsy salutation.) And then
he whispered to me, in queer language, which I could scarcely
understand,&#8217;Your husband is waiting; come with me, my
little sister, and I will take you to him.&#8217; About a league
from the town, beneath a hill, we found four people, men
and women, all very black, like the strange man; and we
joined ourselves with them, and they all saluted me, and
called me &#8216;little sister.&#8217; And away we marched, for many
days, amidst deserts and small villages. The men would
cheat with mules and asses, and the women told baji. I
often asked him (her husband) about the black men, and he
told me that he believed them to be of the Errate.&#8221; Her
husband, then a soldier in the Moorish army, having been
killed, this Gipsy woman married the black man, with whom
she followed real Gipsy life. She said to him: &#8220;Sure I am
amongst the Errate; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I often said that they
were of the Errate; and then they would laugh, and say
that it might be so; and that they were not Moors, (<i>corahai</i>,)
but they could give no account of themselves.&#8221; From this
it would seem that, while preserving their identity, wherever
they go, there are Gipsies who may not be known to the
world, or to the tribe, in other continents, by the same
name.<a name="FNanchor289" id="FNanchor289"></a><a href="#Footnote289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>A word upon the universality of the Gipsies. English
Gipsies, on arriving in America, feel quite taken aback, on
coming across a tent or wigwam of Indians. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you
feel,&#8221; said I to some of them, &#8220;very like a dog when he
comes across another dog, a stranger to him?&#8221; And, with
a laugh, they said, &#8220;Exactly so.&#8221; After looking awhile at
the Indians, they will approach them, and &#8220;cast their sign,
and salute them in Gipsy;&#8221; and if no response is made, they
will pass on. They then come to learn who the Indians are.
The same curiosity is excited among the Gipsies on meeting
with the American farmer, on the banks of the Mississippi
or Missouri; who, in travelling to market, in the summer,
will, to save expenses, unyoke his horses, at mid-day or evening,
at the edge of the forest, light his fire, and prepare his
meal. What with the &#8220;kettle and tented wagon,&#8221; the tall,
lank, bony, and swarthy appearance of the farmer, the Gipsy
will approach him, as he did the Indian; and pass on, when
no response is made to his sign and salutation. Under such
circumstances, the Gipsy would cast his sign, and give his
salutation, whether on the banks of the Mississippi or the
Ganges. Nay, a very respectable Scottish Gipsy boasted to
me, that, by his signs alone, he could push his way to the
wall of China, and even through China itself. And there
are doubtless Gipsies in China. Mr. Borrow says, that when
he visited the tribe at Moscow, they supposed him to be one
of their brothers, who, they said, were wandering about in
Turkey, <i>China</i>, and other parts. It is very likely that Russian
Gipsies have visited China, by the route taken by
Russian traders, and met with Gipsies there.<a name="FNanchor290" id="FNanchor290"></a><a href="#Footnote290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> But it tickles
the Gipsy most, when it is insinuated, that if Sir John Franklin
had been fortunate in his expedition, he would have
found a Gipsy tinkering a kettle at the North Pole.</p>

<p>The particulars of a meeting between English and American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
Gipsies are interesting. Some English Gipsies were
endeavouring to sell some horses, in Annapolis, in the State
of Maryland, to what had the appearance of being respectable
American farmers; who, however, spoke to each other
in the Gipsy language, dropping a word now and then, such
as &#8220;this is a good one,&#8221; and so on. The English Gipsies
felt amazed, and at last said: &#8220;What is that you are saying?
Why, you are Gipsies!&#8221; Upon this, the Americans
wheeled about, and left the spot as fast as they could. Had
the English Gipsies taken after the Gipsy in their appearance,
they would not have caused such a consternation to
their American brethren, who showed much of &#8220;the blood&#8221;
in their countenances; but as, from their blood being much
mixed, they did not look like Gipsies, they gave the others a
terrible fright, on their being found out. The English Gipsies
said they felt disgusted at the others not owning themselves
up. But I told them they ought rather to have felt
proud of the Americans speaking Gipsy, as it was the prejudice
of the world that led them to hide their nationality.
On making enquiry in the neighbourhood, they found that
these American Gipsies had been settled there since, at
least, the time of their grandfather, and that they bore an
English name.</p>

<p>There are Scottish Gipsies in the United States, following
respectable callings, who speak excellent Gipsy, according
to the judgment of intelligent English Gipsies. The English
Gipsies say the same of the Gipsy families in Scotland,
with whom they are acquainted; but that some of their
words vary from those spoken in England. There is, however,
a rivalry between the English and Scottish Gipsies, as
to whose pronunciation of the words is the correct one:
in that respect, they somewhat resemble the English and
Scottish Latinists. One intelligent Gipsy gave it as his
opinion, that the word great, <i>baurie</i>, in Scotland, was softer
than <i>boro</i>, in England, and preferable, indeed, the right pronunciation
of the word. The German Gipsies are said, by
their English brethren, to speak Gipsy backwards; from
which I would conclude, that it follows the construction of
the German language, which differs so materially, in that
respect, from the English.<a name="FNanchor291" id="FNanchor291"></a><a href="#Footnote291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> It is a thing well-nigh impossible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
to get a respectable Scottish Gipsy to own up to
even a word of the Gipsy language. On meeting with a respectable&mdash;Scotchman,
I will call him&mdash;in a company, lately,
I was asked by him: &#8220;Are ye a&#8217; Tinklers?&#8221; &#8220;We&#8217;re travellers,&#8221;
I replied. &#8220;But who is he?&#8221; he continued, pointing
to my acquaintance. Going up to him, I whispered
&#8220;His <i>dade</i> is a <i>baurie grye-femler</i>,&#8221; (his father is a great
horse-dealer;) and he made for the door, as if a bee had
got into his ear. But he came back; oh, yes, he came
back. There was a mysterious whispering of &#8220;pistols and
coffee,&#8221; at another time.</p>

<p>It is beyond doubt that the Gipsy language in Great Britain
is broken, but not so broken as to consist of words only;
it consists, rather, of expressions, or pieces, which are tacked
together by native words&mdash;generally small words&mdash;which
are lost to the ordinary ear, when used in conversation. In
that respect, the use of Gipsy may be compared to the revolutions
of a wheel: we know that the wheel has spokes, but,
in its velocity, we cannot distinguish the colour or material
of each individual spoke; it is only when it stands still that
that can be done. In the same manner, when we come to
examine into the British Gipsy language, we perceive its
broken nature. But it still serves the purpose of a speech.
Let any one sit among English Gipsies, in America, and
hear them converse, and he cannot pick up an idea, and
hardly a word which they say. &#8220;I have always thought
Dutch bad enough,&#8221; said an Irishman, who has often heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
English Gipsies, in the State of New Jersey, speak among
themselves; &#8220;but Gipsy is perfect gibble-gabble, like ducks
and geese, for anything I can make of it.&#8221; Some Gipsies
can, of course, speak Gipsy much better than others. It is
most unlikely that the Scottish Gipsies, with the head, the
pride, and the tenacity of native Scotch, would be the first
to forget the Gipsy language. The sentiments of the people
themselves are very emphatic on that head. &#8220;It will never
be forgotten, sir; it is in our hearts, and, as long as a single
Tinkler exists, it will be remembered,&#8221; (<a href="#Page_297">page 297</a>.) &#8220;So
long as there existed two Gipsies in Scotland, it would never
be lost,&#8221; (<a href="#Page_316">page 316</a>.) The English Gipsies admit that the
language is more easily preserved in a settled life, but more
useful to travelling and out-door Gipsies; and that it is
carefully kept up by both classes of Gipsies. This information
agrees with our author&#8217;s, in regard to the settled Scottish
Gipsies. There is one very strong motive, among many,
for the Gipsies keeping up their language, and that is, as I
have already said, their self-respect. The best of them believe
that it is altogether problematical how they would be
received in society, were they to make an avowal of their
being Gipsies, and lay bare the history of their race to the
world. The prejudice that exists against the race, and
against them, they imagine, were they known to be Gipsies,
drives them back on that language which belongs exclusively
to themselves; to say nothing of the dazzling hold which it
takes of their imagination, as they arrive at years of reflection,
and consider that the people speaking it have been
transplanted from some other clime. The more intelligent
the Gipsy, the more he thinks of his speech, and the more
care he takes of it.</p>

<p>People often reprobate the dislike, I may say the hatred,
which the more original Gipsy entertains for society; forgetting
that society itself has had the greatest share in the
origin of it. When the race entered Europe, they are not
presumed to have had any hatred towards their fellow-creatures.<a name="FNanchor292" id="FNanchor292"></a><a href="#Footnote292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
That hatred, doubtless, sprang from the severe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
reception, and universal persecution, which, owing to the
singularity of their race and habits, they everywhere met
with. The race then became born into that state of things.
What would subsequent generations know of the origin of
the feud? All that they knew was, that the law made
them outlaws and outcasts; that they were subject, as Gipsies,
to be hung, before they were born. Such a Gipsy
might be compared to Pascal&#8217;s man springing up out of an
island: casting his eyes around him, he finds nothing but a
legal and social proscription hanging over his head, in whatever
direction he may turn. Whatever might be assumed
to have been the original, innate disposition of a Gipsy, the
circumstances attending him, from his birth to his death, were
certainly not calculated to improve him, but to make him
much worse than he might otherwise have been. The worst
that can be said of the Scottish Gipsies, in times past, has
been stated by our author. With all their faults, we find a
vein of genuine nobility of character running through all
their actions, which is the more worthy of notice, considering
that they were at war with society, and society at war
with them. Not the least important feature is that of gratitude
for kind and hospitable treatment. In that respect,
a true Scottish Gipsy has always been as true as steel; and
that is saying a great deal in his favour. The instance
given by our author, (<a href="#Page_361">pages 361</a>-<a href="#Page_363">363</a>,) is very touching, and
to the point. I do not know how it may be, at the present
day, in Scotland, where are to be found so many Irish
Gipsies, of whom the Scottish and English Gipsies have not
much good to say, notwithstanding the assistance they render
each other when they meet, (<a href="#Page_324">page 324</a>.) If the English
farmers are questioned, I doubt not that a somewhat similar
testimony will be borne to the English Gipsies, to this extent,
at least, that, when civilly and hospitably treated, and personally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
acquainted, they will respect the farmers&#8217; property,
and even keep others off it. Indeed, both Scottish and
English Gipsies call this &#8220;Gipsy law.&#8221; It is certainly not
the Scottish Gipsies, or, I may venture to say, the English
Gipsies, to whom Mr. Borrow&#8217;s words may be applied, when
he says: &#8220;I have not expatiated on their gratitude towards
good people, who treat them kindly, and take an interest in
their welfare; for I believe, that, of all beings in the world,
they are the least susceptible of such a feeling.&#8221; Such a
character may apply to the Spanish Gipsies for anything I
know to the contrary; and the causes to which it may be
attributed must be the influences which the Spanish character,
and general deportment towards the tribe, have exercised
over them. In speaking of the bloody and wolfish
disposition which especially characterizes the Gitanos, Mr.
Borrow says: &#8220;The cause to which this must be attributed,
must be their residence in a country, unsound in every
branch of its civil polity, where right has ever been in less
esteem, and wrong in less disrepute, than in any other part of
the world.&#8221; Grellmann bears as poor testimony to the
character of the Hungarian Gipsies, in the matter of gratitude,
as Mr. Borrow does to the Spanish Gipsies, to whom I
apprehend his remarks are intended to apply. But both of
these authors give an opinion, unaccompanied by facts.
Their opinion may be correct, however, so far as it is applicable
to the class of Gipsies, or the individuals, to whom they
refer. Gratitude is even a characteristic of the lower animals.
&#8220;For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents,
and of things in the sea, is tamed and hath been
tamed of mankind,&#8221; saith St. James; the means of attaining
to which is frequently kindness. I doubt not that the same
can be said of Gipsies anywhere; for surely we can expect
to find as much gratitude in them as can be called forth
from things that creep, fly, or swim in the sea. It is unreasonable,
however, to look for much gratitude from such
Gipsies as the two authors in question have evidently alluded
to; for this reason: that it is a virtue rarely to be met with
from those &#8220;to whom much has been given;&#8221; and, consequently,
very little should be required of those to whom
<i>nothing</i> has been given, in the estimation of their fellow-creatures.
In doing a good turn to a Gipsy, it is not the
act itself that calls forth, or perhaps merits, a return in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
gratitude; but it is the way in which it is done: for, while
he is doubtless being benefited, he is, frequently if not generally,
as little sympathized with, personally, as if he were
some loathsome creature to which something had been
thrown.</p>

<p>As regards the improvement of the Gipsies, I would make
the following suggestions: The facts and principles of the
present work should be thoroughly canvassed and imprinted
upon the public mind, and an effort made to bring, if possible,
our high-class Gipsies to own themselves up to be
Gipsies. The fact of these Gipsies being received into society,
and respected, as Gipsies, (as it is with them, at present,
as men,) could not fail to have a wonderful effect upon many
of the humble, ignorant, or wild ones. They would perceive,
at once, that the objections which the community had to
them, proceeded, not from their being Gipsies, but from
their habits, only. What is the feeling which Gipsies, who
are known to be Gipsies, have for the public at large?
The white race, as a race, is simply odious to them, for they
know well the dreadful prejudice which it bears towards
them. But let some of their own race, however mixed the
blood might be, be respected as Gipsies, and it would, in a
great measure, break down, at least in feeling, the wall of
caste that separates them from the community at large. This
is the first, the most important, step to be taken to improve
the Gipsies, whatever may be the class to which they belong.
Let the prejudice be removed, and it is impossible to say
what might not follow. Before attempting to reform the
Gipsies, we ought to reform, or, at least, inform, mankind in
regard to them; and endeavour to reconcile the world to
them, before we attempt to reconcile them to the world; and
treat them as men, before we try to make them Christians.
The <i>poor</i> Gipsies know well that there are many of their race
occupying respectable positions in life; perhaps they do not
know many, or even any, of them, personally, but they believe
in it thoroughly. Still, they will deny it, at least hide it from
strangers, for this reason, among others, that it is a state to
which their children, or even they themselves, look forward,
as ultimately awaiting them, in which they will manage to
escape from the odium of their fellow-creatures, which clings
to them in their present condition. The fact of the poor
travelling Gipsies knowing of such respectable settled Gipsies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
gives them a certain degree of respect in their own
eyes, which leads them to repel any advance from the other
race, let it come in almost whatever shape it may. The
white race, as I have already said, is perfectly odious to
them. This is exactly the position of the question. The
more original kind of Gipsies feel that the prejudice which
exists against the race to which they belong is such, that an
intercourse cannot be maintained between them and the
other inhabitants; or, if it does exist, it is of so clandestine a
nature, that their appearance, and, it may be, their general
habits, do not allow or lead them to indulge in it. I will
make a few more remarks on this subject further on in this
treatise.</p>

<p>What are the respectable, well-disposed Scottish Gipsies
but Scotch people, after all? They are to be met with in
almost every, if not every, sphere in which the ordinary Scot
is to be found. The only difference between the two is,
that, however mixed the blood of these Gipsies may be,
their associations of descent and tribe go back to those
black, mysterious heroes who entered Scotland, upwards of
three hundred and fifty years ago; and that, with this descent,
they have the words and signs of Gipsies. The possession
of all these, with the knowledge of the feelings
which the ordinary natives have for the very name of Gipsy,
makes the only distinction between them and other Scotchmen.
I do not say that the world would have any prejudice
against these Gipsies, as Gipsies, still, they are morbidly sensitive
that it would have such a feeling. The light of reason,
of civilization, of religion, and the genius of Britons, forbid
such an idea. What object more worthy of civilization, and
of the age in which we live, than that such Gipsies would come
forward, and, by their positions in society, their talents and
characters, dispel the mystery and gloom that hang over the
history of the Gipsy race!</p>

<p>But will these Gipsies do that? I have my misgivings.
They may not do it now, but I am sanguine enough to think
that it is an event that may take place at some future time.
The subject must, in the meantime, be thoroughly investigated,
and the mind of the public fully prepared for such a
movement. The Gipsies themselves, to commence with,
should furnish the public with information, anonymously, so
far as they are personally concerned, or confidentially,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
through a person of standing, who can guarantee the trustworthiness
of the Gipsy himself. I do not expect that they
would give us any of the language; but they can furnish us
with some idea of the position which the Gipsies occupy in
the world, and throw a great deal of light upon the history
of the race in Scotland, in, at least, comparatively recent
times. In anticipation of such an occurrence, I would make
this suggestion to them: that they must be very careful
what they say, on account of the &#8220;court holding them interested
witnesses;&#8221; and, whatever they may do, to deny
nothing connected with the Gipsies. They certainly have
kept their secret well; indeed, they have considered the
subject, so far as the public is concerned, as dead and buried
long ago. It is of no use, however, Gipsies; &#8220;murder will
out;&#8221; the game is up; it is played out. I may say to you
what the hunter said to the &#8216;coon, or rather what the &#8216;coon
said to the hunter: &#8220;You may just as well come down the
tree.&#8221; Yes! come down the tree; you have been too long
up; come down, and let us know all about you.<a name="FNanchor293" id="FNanchor293"></a><a href="#Footnote293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p>Scottish Gipsies! I now appeal to you as men. Am I not
right, in asserting, that there is nothing you hold more dear
than your Egyptian descent, signs, and language? And
nothing you more dread than such becoming known to your
fellow-men around you? Do you not read, with the greatest
interest, any and everything printed, which comes in your
way, about the Gipsies, and say, that you thank God all that
is a thousand miles away from you? Whence this inconsistency?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
Ah! I understand it well. Shall the prejudice of
mankind towards the name of Gipsy drive you from the
position which you occupy? Can it drive you from it? No,
it cannot. The Gipsies, you know, are a people; a &#8220;mixed
multitude,&#8221; no doubt, but still a people. You know you are
Gipsies, for your parents before you were Gipsies, and, consequently,
that you cannot be anything but Gipsies. What
effect, then, has the prejudice against the race upon you?
Does it not sometimes appear to you as if, figuratively speaking,
it would put a dagger into your hands against the rest
of your species, should they discover that you belonged to
the tribe? Or that it would lead you to immediately &#8220;take
to your beds,&#8221; or depart, bed and baggage, to parts unknown?
But then, Gipsies, what can you do? The thought of it
makes you feel as if you were sheep. Some of you may be
bold enough to face a lion in the flesh; but who so bold as
to own to the world that he is a Gipsy? There is just one of
the higher class that I know of, and he was a noble specimen
of a man, a credit to human nature itself. Although
<i>you</i> might shrink from such a step, would you not like, and
cannot you induce, <i>some one</i> to take it? Take my word for
it, respectable Scottish Gipsies, the thing that frightens you
is, after all, a bug-bear&mdash;a scare-crow. But, failing some of
you &#8220;coming out,&#8221; would you not rather that the world
should now know that much of the history of the Gipsy race,
as to show that it was no necessary disparagement in any
of you to be a Gipsy? Would you not rather that a Gipsy
<i>might</i> pass, anywhere, for a <i>gentleman</i>, as he <i>does</i> now, everywhere,
for a <i>vagabond</i>; and that you and your children
might, if they liked, show their true colours, than, as at present,
go everywhere <i>incog</i>, and carry within them that
secret which they are as afraid of being divulged to the
world, as if you and all your kin were conspirators and murderers?
The secret being out, the incognito of your race
goes for nothing. Come then, Scottish Gipsy, make a clean
breast of it, like a man. Which of you will exclaim,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;Thus from the grave I&#8217;ll rise, and save my love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Draw all your swords, and quick as lightning move!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I rush on, sure none will dare to stay;<br /></span>
<span class="i00">&#8216;Tis love commands, and glory leads the way!&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Will none of you move? Ah! Gipsies, you are &#8220;great
hens,&#8221; and no wonder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>American Gipsies, descendants of the real old British
stock! I make the same appeal to you. Let the world
know how you are getting on, in this land of &#8220;liberty and
equality;&#8221; and whether any of your race are senators, congressmen,
and what not. I have heard of a Gipsy, a sheriff
in the State of Pennsylvania; and I know of a Scottish
Gipsy, who was lately returned a member of the Legislature
of the State of New York.</p>

<p>The reader may ask: Is it possible that there is a race of
men, residing in the British Isles, to be counted by its hundreds
of thousands, occupying such a position as that described?
And I reply, Alas! it is too true. Exeter Hall
may hobnob with Negroes, Hottentots, and Bosjesmen&mdash;always
with something or other from a distance; but what
has it ever done for the Gipsies? Nothing! It will rail
at the American prejudice towards the Negro, and entirely
pass over a much superior race at its own door! The
prejudice against the Negro proceeds from two causes&mdash;his
appearance and the servitude in which he is, or has been,
held. But there can be no prejudice against the Gipsy, on
such grounds. It will not do to say that the prejudice is
against the tented Gipsies, only; it is against the race, root
and branch, as far as it is known. What is it but that
which compels the Gipsy, on entering upon a settled life, to
hide himself from the unearthly prejudice of his fellow-creatures?
The Englishman, the Scotchman, and the Irishman
may rail at the American for his peculiar prejudices;
but the latter, if he can but capitalize the idea, has, in all
conscience, much to throw back upon society in the mother
country. Instead of a class of the British public spending
so much of their time in an agitation against an institution
thousands of miles away from home, and over which they
have, and can expect to have, no control, they might direct
their attention to an evil laying at their own doors&mdash;that
social prejudice which is so much calculated to have a blasting
influence upon the condition of so many of their fellow-subjects.
It is beyond doubt that there cannot be less than
a quarter of a million of Gipsies in the British Isles, who
are living under a grinding despotism of caste; a despotism
so absolute and odious, that the people upon whom it bears
cannot, as in Scotland, were it almost to save their lives,
even say who they are! Let the time and talents spent on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
the agitation in question be transferred, for a time, into
some such channel as would be implied in a &#8220;British Anti-Gipsy-prejudice
Association,&#8221; and a great moral evil may
disappear from the face of British society. In such a movement,
there would be none of that direct or indirect interest
to be encountered, which lies on the very threshold of slavery,
in whatever part of the world it exists; nor would there
be any occasion to appeal to people&#8217;s pockets.<a name="FNanchor294" id="FNanchor294"></a><a href="#Footnote294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> After the
work mentioned has been accomplished, the British public
might turn their attention to wrongs perpetrated in other
climes. Americans, however, must not attempt to seek, in
the British Gipsy-prejudice, an excuse for their excessive
antipathy towards Negroes. I freely admit that the dislike
of white men, generally, for the Negro, lies in something that
is irremovable&mdash;something that is irrespective of character,
or present or previous social condition. But it is not so with
the Gipsy, for his race is, physically, among the finest that
are to be found on the face of the earth. Americans ought
also to consider that there are plenty of Gipsies among
themselves, towards whom, however, there are none of those
prejudices that spring from local tradition or association,
but only such as proceed from literature, and that towards
the tented Gipsy.</p>

<p>What is to be the future of the Gipsy race? A reply to
this question will be found in the history of it during the
past, as described; for it resolves itself into two very simple
matters of fact. In the first place, we have a foreign race,
deemed, by itself, to be, as indeed it is, universal, introduced
into Scotland, for example, taken root there, spread, and
flourished; a race that rests upon a basis the strongest
imaginable. On the other hand, there is the prejudice of
caste towards the name, which those bearing it escape, only,
by assuming an incognito among their fellow-creatures.
These two principles, acting upon beings possessing the feelings
of men, will, of themselves, produce that state of things
which will constitute the history of the Gipsies during all
time coming, whatever may be the changes that may come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
over their character and condition. They may, in course
of time, lose their language, as some of them, to a great extent,
have done already; but they will always retain a consciousness
of being Gipsies. The language may be lost, but
their signs will remain, as well as so much of their speech
as will serve the purpose of pass-words. &#8220;There is something
there,&#8221; said an English Gipsy of intelligence, smiting
his breast, &#8220;There is something there which a Gipsy cannot
explain.&#8221; And, said a Scottish Gipsy: &#8220;It will never be
forgotten; as long as the world lasts, the Gipsies will be
Gipsies.&#8221; What idea can be more preposterous than that
of saying, that a change of residence or occupation, or a
little more or less of education or wealth, or a change of
character or creed, can eradicate such feeling from the heart
of a Gipsy; or that these circumstances can, by any human
possibility, change his descent, his tribe, or the blood that is
in his body? How can we imagine this race, arriving in
Europe so lately as the fifteenth century, and in Scotland the
century following, with an origin so distinct from the rest
of the world, and so treated by the world, can possibly have
lost a consciousness of nationality in its descent, in so short
a time after arrival; or, that that can happen in the future,
when there are so many circumstances surrounding it to
keep alive a sense of its origin, and so much within it to
preserve its identity in the history of the human family?
Let the future history of the world be what it may, Gipsydom
is immortal.<a name="FNanchor295" id="FNanchor295"></a><a href="#Footnote295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>In considering the question of the Gipsies being openly
admitted, as a race, into the society of mankind, I ask, what
possible reason could a British subject advance against such
taking place with, at least, the better kind of Scottish Gipsies?
Society, generally, would not be over-ready to lessen
the distance between itself and the tented Gipsies, or those
who live by means really objectionable; but it should have
that much sense of justice, as to confine its peculiar feelings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
to the ways of life of these individuals, and not keep them
up against their children, when they follow different habits.
If, for example, I should have made the acquaintance of
some Scottish Gipsies, associated with them, and acquired a
respect for them, (as has happened with me,) how could I
take exceptions to them, on account of it afterwards leaking
out that they were Gipsies? A sense of ordinary justice
would forbid me doing so. I can see nothing objectionable
in their conduct, as distinguished from that of other people;
and as for their appearance, any person, on being asked to
point out the Gipsy, would, so far as colour of hair and eyes
goes, pitch upon many a common native, in preference to
them. A sense of ordinary justice, as I have said, would
disarm me of any prejudice against them; nay, it would urge
me to think the more of them, on account of their being
Gipsies. To the ordinary eye, they are nothing but Scotch
people, and pass, everywhere, for such. There is a Scottish
Gipsy in the United States, with whom I am acquainted&mdash;a
liberal-minded man, and good company&mdash;who carries
on a wholesale trade, in a respectable article of merchandise,
and he said to me: &#8220;I will not deny it, nor am I ashamed
to say it&mdash;<i>I come from Yetholm</i>.&#8221; And I replied: &#8220;Why
should you be ashamed of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>It is this hereditary prejudice of centuries towards the
name, that constitutes the main difficulty in the way of recognition
of these Gipsies by the world generally. How long
it may be since they or their ancestors left the tent, is a
thing of no importance; personal character, education, and
position in life, are the only things that should be considered.
The Gipsies to whom I allude do not require to be reformed,
unless in that sense in which all men stand in need of reformation:
what is wanted is, that the world should raise up
the name of Gipsy. And why should not that be done by
the people of Great Britain, and Scotland especially, in
whose mouths are continually these words: &#8220;God hath made
of one blood all nations of men, for to dwell on all the face
of the earth?&#8221; Will the British public spend its hundreds
of thousands, annually, on every other creature under heaven,
and refuse to countenance the Gipsy race? Will it
squander its tens of thousands to convert, perhaps, on an
average, one Jew, and refuse a kind word, nay, grudge a
smile, towards that body, a member of which may be an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
official of that Missionary Society, or, it may be, the very
chairman of it? I can conceive no liberal-minded Scotchman,
possessing a feeling of true self-respect, entertaining a
prejudice against such Gipsies. The only people in Scotland
in whose mind such a prejudice might be supposed to exist,
are those miserable old women around the neighbourhood of
Stirling, who, under the influence of the old Highland feud,
will look with the greatest contempt upon a person, if he but
come from the north of the Ochils. I would class, with such
old women, all of our Scotch people who would object to the
Gipsies to whom I have alluded. A Scotchman should even
have that much love of country, as to take hold of his own
Gipsies, and &#8220;back them up&#8221; against those of other countries:
and particularly should he do that, when the &#8220;Gipsies&#8221;
might be his cousins, nay, his own children, for anything
that he might know to the contrary. Scotch people
should consider that the &#8220;Tinklers,&#8221; whom they see going
about, at the present day, are, if not the very lowest kind of
Gipsies, at least those who follow the original ways of their
race; and are greatly inferior, not only relatively, but actually,
to many of those who have gone before them. They
should also consider that Gipsies are a race, however mixed
the blood may be; subject, as a race, to be governed, in their
descent, by those laws which regulate the descent of all
races; and that a Gipsy is as much a Gipsy in a house as in
a tent, in a &#8220;but and a ben&#8221; as in a palace.</p>

<p>Wherever a Gipsy goes, he carries his inherent peculiarities
with him; and the objection to him he considers to be
to something inseparable from himself&mdash;that which he cannot
escape; but the confidence which he has in his incognito
neutralizes, as I have already said, the feelings which such a
circumstance would naturally produce. But, to disarm him
altogether of this feeling, all that is necessary is to state his
case, and have it admitted by the &#8220;honourable of the earth;&#8221;
so that his mind may be set at perfect rest on that point.
He would, doubtless, still hide the fact of his being a Gipsy,
but he would enjoy, in his retreat, that inward self-respect,
among his fellow-creatures, which such an admission would
give him; and which is so much calculated to raise the people,
generally, in every moral attribute. It is, indeed, a melancholy
thing, to contemplate this cloud which hangs over
such a man, as he mixes with other people, in his daily calling;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
but to dispel it altogether, the Gipsy himself must, in
the manner described, give us some information about his
race. Apart from the sense of justice which is implied in
admitting these Gipsies, as Gipsies, to a social equality with
others, a motive of policy should lead us to take such a step;
for it can augur no good to society to have the Gipsy race
residing in its midst, under the cloud that hangs over it.
Let us, by a liberal and enlightened policy, at least blunt
the edge of that antipathy which many of the Gipsy race
have, and most naturally have, to society at large.</p>

<p>In receiving a Gipsy, as a Gipsy, into society, there should
be no kind of officious sympathy shown him, for he is too proud
to submit to be made the object of it. Should he say that he is
a Gipsy, the remark ought to be received as a mere matter
of course, and little notice taken of it; just as if it made no
difference to the other party whether he was a Gipsy or not.
A little surprise would be allowable; but anything like condolence
would be out of the question. And let the Gipsy
himself, rather, talk upon the subject, than a desire be shown
to ask him questions, unless his remarks should allow them,
in a natural way, to be put to him. As to the course to be
pursued by the Gipsy, should he feel disposed to own himself
up, I would advise him to do it in an off-handed, hearty
manner; to show not the least appearance that he had any
misgivings about any one taking exceptions to him on that
account. Should he act otherwise, that is, hesitate, and
take to himself shamefacedness, in making the admission, it
would, perhaps, have been better for him not to have committed
himself at all: for, in such a matter, it may be said,
that &#8220;he that doubteth is damned.&#8221; The simple fact of a
man, in Scotland, saying, after the appearance of this work
there, that he is a Gipsy, if he is conscious of having the
esteem of his neighbours, would probably add to his popularity
among them; especially if they were men of good
sense, and had before their eyes the expression of good-will
of the organs of society towards the Gipsy race. Such an
admission, on the part of a Gipsy, would presumptively
prove, that he was a really candid and upright person; for
few Scottish Gipsies, beyond those about Yetholm, would
make such a confession. Having mentioned the subject, the
Gipsy should allude to it, on every appropriate occasion,
and boast of being in possession of those words and signs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
which the other is entirely ignorant of. He could well say:
&#8220;What was Borrow to him, or he to Borrow; that, for his
part, he could traverse the world over, and, in the centre of
any continent, be received and feasted, by Gipsies, as a king.&#8221;
If but one respectable Scottish Gipsy could be prevailed
upon to act in this way, what an effect might it not have
upon raising up the name of this singular race! But there
is a very serious difficulty to be encountered in the outset of
such a proceeding, and it is this, that if a Gipsy owns himself
up, he necessarily &#8220;lets out,&#8221; perhaps, all his kith and
kin; a regard for whom would, in all probability, keep him
back. But there would be no such difficulty to be met with
in the way of the Gipsy giving us information by writing.
Let us, then, Gipsy, have some writing upon the Gipsies. It
will serve no good purpose to keep such information back;
the keeping of it back will not cast a doubt upon the facts
and principles of the present work; for rest assured, Gipsy,
that, upon its own merits, your secret is exploded. I would
say this to you, young Scottish Gipsy; pay no regard to what
that old Gipsy says, when he tells you, that &#8220;he is too old
a bird to be caught with chaff in that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The history of the Gipsies is the history of a people
(mixed, in point of blood, as it is,) which exists; not the history
of a people, like the Aborigines of North America,
which has ceased to exist, or is daily ceasing to exist.<a name="FNanchor296" id="FNanchor296"></a><a href="#Footnote296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> It
is the history of a people within a people, with whom we
come in contact daily, although we may not be aware of it.
Any person of ordinary intelligence can have little difficulty
in comprehending the subject, shrouded as it is from the eye
of the world. But should he have any such difficulty, it will
be dispelled by his coming in contact with a Gipsy who has
the courage to own himself up to be a Gipsy. It is no argument
to maintain that the Gipsy race is not a race, because
its blood is mixed with other people. That can be
said of all the races of Western Europe, the English more
especially; and, in a much greater degree, of that of the
United States of America. Every Gipsy has part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
Gipsy blood, and more or less of the words and signs; which,
taken in connection with the rearing of Gipsies, act upon
his mind in such a manner, that he is penetrated with the
simple idea that he is a Gipsy; and create that distinct feeling
of nationality which the matters of territory, and sometimes
dialect, government, and laws, do with most of other
races. Take a Gipsy from any country in the world you
may, and the feeling of his being a Gipsy comes as naturally
to him as does the nationality of a Jew to a Jew; although
we will naturally give him a more definite name, to distinguish
him; such as an English, Welsh, Scotch, or Irish
Gipsy, or by whatever country of which the Gipsy happens
to be a native.</p>

<p>But I am afraid that what has been said is not sufficiently
explanatory to enable some people to understand this subject.
These people know what a Gipsy, in the popular sense,
means; they have either seen him, and observed his general
mode of life, or had the same described to them in books.
This idea of a Gipsy has been impressed upon their minds
almost from infancy. But it puzzles most people to form any
idea of a Gipsy of a higher order; such a Gipsy, for example,
as preaches the gospel, or argues the law: that seems,
hitherto, to have been almost incomprehensible to them.
They know intuitively what is meant by any particular people
who occupy a territory&mdash;any country, tract of land, or
isle. They also know what is meant by the existence of the
Jews. For the subject is familiar to them from infancy;
it is wrapt up in their early reading; it is associated with
the knowledge and practice of their religion, and the attendance,
on the part of the Jews, at a place of worship. They
have likewise seen and conversed with the Jews, or others
who have done either or both; or they are acquainted with
them by the current remarks of the world. But a people
resembling, in so many respects, the Jews, without having
any territory, or form of creed, peculiar to itself, or any history,
or any peculiar outward associations or residences, or
any material difference in appearance, character, or occupation,
is something that the general mind of mankind
would seem never to have dreamt of, or to be almost capable
of realizing to itself. We have already seen how a
writer in Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine gravely asserts, that, although
&#8220;Billy Marshall left descendants numberless, the race,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
of which he was one, was in danger of becoming extinct;&#8221;
when, in fact, it had only passed from its first stage of existence&mdash;the
tent, into its second&mdash;tramping, without the
tent; and after that, into its ultimate stage&mdash;a settled life.
We have likewise seen how Sir Walter Scott imagines that
the Scottish Gipsies have decreased, since the time of
Fletcher, of Saltoun, about the year 1680, from 100,000 to
500, by &#8220;the progress of time, and encrease of the means of
life, and the power of the laws.&#8221; Mr. Borrow has not gone
one step ahead of these writers; and, although I naturally
enough excuse them, I am not inclined to let him go scot-free,
since he has set himself forward so prominently as an
authority on the Gipsy question.<a name="FNanchor297" id="FNanchor297"></a><a href="#Footnote297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>In explaining this subject, it is by no means necessary to
&#8220;crack an egg&#8221; for the occasion. There is doubtless a
&#8220;hitch,&#8221; but it is a hitch so close under our very noses, that
it has escaped the observation of the world. Still, the point
can be readily enough realized by any one. Take, for example,
the Walker family. Walker knows well enough who
his father, grandfather, and so forth were; and holds himself
to be a Walker. Is it not so with the Gipsies? What
is it but a question of &#8220;folk?&#8221; A question more familiar
to Scotch people than any other people. If one&#8217;s ancestors
were all Walkers, is not the present Walker still a Walker?
If such or such a family was originally of the Gipsy race, is
it not so still? How did Billy Marshall happen to be a
Gipsy? Was he a Gipsy because he lived in a tent? or,
did he live in a tent, like a Gipsy of the old stock? If Billy
was a Gipsy, surely Billy&#8217;s children must also have been
Gipsies!</p>

<p>The error committed by writers, with reference to the so-called
&#8220;dying-out&#8221; of the Gipsy race, arises from their not
distinguishing between the questions of race, blood, descent,
and language, and a style of life, or character, or mode of
making a living. Suppose that a native Scottish cobbler
should leave his last, and take to peddling, as a packman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
and ultimately settle again in a town, as a respectable tradesman.
On quitting &#8220;the roads,&#8221; he would cease to be a
packman; nor could his children after him be called packmen,
because the whole family were native Scotch from the
first; following the pack having been only the occupation of
the father, during part of his life. Should a company of
American youths and maidens take to the swamp, cranberrying
and gipsying, for a time, it could not be said that they
had become Gipsies; for they were nothing but ordinary
Americans. Should the society of Quakers dissolve into its
original elements, it would just be English blood quakerized,
returning to English blood before it was quakerized.
But it is astonishing that intelligent men should conceive,
and others retail, the ideas that have been expressed in regard
to the destiny of the Gipsy race. What avails the lessons
of history, or the daily experience of every family of
the land, the common sense of mankind, or the instinct of a
Hottentot, if no other idea of the fate of the Gipsy race can
be given than that referred to? Upon the principle of the
Gipsies &#8220;dying out,&#8221; by settling, and changing their habits,
it would appear that, when at home, in the winter, they were
not Gipsies; but that they were Gipsies, when they resumed
their habits, in the spring! On the same principle, it would
appear, that, if every Gipsy in the world were to disappear
from the roads and the fields, and drop his original habits,
there would be no Gipsies in the world, at all! What idea
can possibly be more ridiculous?<a name="FNanchor298" id="FNanchor298"></a><a href="#Footnote298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>It is better, however, to compare the Gipsy tribe in Scotland,
at the present day, to an ordinary clan in the olden
time; although the comparison falls far short of the idea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
We know perfectly well what it was to have been a member
of this or that clan. Sir Walter Scott knew well that
he was one of the Buccleuch clan, and a descendant of <i>Auld
Beardie</i>; so that he could readily say that he was a Scott.
Wherein, then, consists the difficulty in understanding what
a Scottish Gipsy is? Is it not simply that he is &#8220;one of
them;&#8221; a descendant of that foreign race of which we have
such notice in the treaty of 1540, between James V. and
John Faw, the then head of the Scottish Gipsy tribe? A
Scottish Gipsy has the blood, the words, and the signs, of
these men, and as naturally holds himself to be &#8220;one of
them,&#8221; as a native Scotchman holds himself to be one of his
father&#8217;s children. How, then, can a &#8220;change of habits&#8221;
prevent a man from being his father&#8217;s son? How could a
&#8220;change of habits&#8221; make a McGregor anything but a McGregor?
How could the effects of any just and liberal law
towards the McGregors lead to the decrease, and final extinction,
of the McGregors? Every man, every family,
every clan, and every people, are continually &#8220;changing
their habits,&#8221; but still remain the same people. It would be
a treat to have a treatise from Mr. Borrow upon the Gipsy
race &#8220;dying out,&#8221; by &#8220;changing its habits,&#8221; or by the acts
of any government, or by ideas of &#8220;gentility.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have already alluded to a resemblance between the position
of the Gipsy race, at the present day, and that of the
English and American races. Does any one say that the
English race is not a race? Or that the American is not a
race? And yet the latter is a compost of everything that
migrates from the Old World. But take some families, and
we will find that they are almost pure English, in descent,
and hold themselves to be actually such. But ask them if
they are English, and they will readily answer: &#8220;<i>English?</i>
No, siree!&#8221; The same principle holds still more with the
Gipsy race. It is not a question of country against country,
or government against government, separated by an ocean;
but the difference proceeds from a prejudice, as broad and
deep as the ocean, that exists between two races&mdash;the native,
and that of such recent introduction&mdash;dwelling in the same
community.</p>

<p>I have explained the effect which the mixing of native
blood with Gipsy has upon the Gipsy race, showing that it
only modifies its appearance, and facilitates its passing into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
settled and respectable life. I will now substantiate the
principle from what is daily observed among the native race
itself. Take any native family&mdash;one of the Scotts, for example.
Let us commence with a family, tracing its origin
to a Scott, in the year 1600, and imagine that, in its descent,
every representative of the name married a wife of
another family, or clan, having no Scotts&#8217; blood in her veins.
In the seventh descent, there would be only one one-hundred
and twenty-eighth part of the original Scott in the last representative
of the family. Would not the last Scott be a
Scott? The world recognizes him to be a Scott; he holds
himself to be a Scott&mdash;&#8220;every inch a Scott;&#8221; and doubtless
he is a Scott, as much as his ancestor who existed in the year
1600. What difficulty can there, therefore, be, in understanding
how a man can be a Gipsy, whose blood is mixed,
even &#8220;dreadfully mixed,&#8221; as the English Gipsies express it?
Gipsies are Gipsies, let their blood be mixed as much as it
may; whether the introduction of the native blood may
have come into the family through the male or the female
line.</p>

<p>In the descent of a native family, in the instance given,
the issue follows the name of the family. But, with the
Gipsy race, the thing to be transmitted is not merely a question
of family, but a race distinct from any particular family.
If a Gipsy woman marries into a native family, the issue
retains the family name of the husband, but passes into the
Gipsy tribe; if a Gipsy man marries into a native family,
the issue retains his name, in the general order of society,
and likewise passes into the Gipsy tribe; so that such
intermarriages, which almost invariably take place unknown
to the native race, always leave the issue Gipsy.
For the Gipsy element of society is like a troubled
spirit, which has been despised, persecuted, and damned;
cross it out, to appearance, as much as you may, it still
retains its Gipsy identity. It then assumes the form of
a disembodied spirit, that will enter into any kind of
tabernacle, in the manner described, dispel every other
kind of spirit, clean or unclean, as the case may be, and
come up, under any garb, colour, character, occupation, or creed&mdash;Gipsy.
It is perfectly possible, but not very probable, to
find a Gipsy a Jew, in creed, and, for the most part, in point
of blood, in the event of a Jew marrying a mixed Gipsy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
He might follow the creed of the Jewish parent, and be admitted
into the synagogue; but, although outwardly recognised
as a Jew, and having Jewish features, he would still
be a <i>chabo</i>; for there are Gipsies of all creeds, and, like
other people in the world, of no creed at all. But it is extremely
disagreeable to a Gipsy to have such a subject mentioned
in his hearing; for he heartily dislikes a Jew, and
says that no one has any &#8220;chance&#8221; in dealing with him. A
Gipsy likewise says, that the two races ought not to be mentioned
in the same breath, or put on the same footing, which
is very true; for reason tells us, that, strip the Gipsy of
every idea connected with &#8220;taking bits o&#8217; things,&#8221; and leading
a wild life, and there should be no points of enmity
between him and the ordinary native; certainly not that of
creed, which exists between the Jew and the rest of the
world, to which question I will by and by refer.</p>

<p>The subject of the Gipsies has hitherto been treated as a
question of natural history, only, in the same manner as we
would treat ant-bears. Writers have sat down beside them,
and looked at them&mdash;little more than looked at them&mdash;described
some of their habits, and reported their <i>chaff</i>. To
get to the bottom of the subject, it is necessary to sound the
mind of the Gipsy, lay open and dissect his heart, identify
one&#8217;s self with his feelings, and the bearings of his ideas,
and construct, out of these, a system of mental science, based
upon the mind of the Gipsy, and human nature generally.
For it is the mind of the Gipsy that constitutes the Gipsy;
that which, in reference to its singular origin and history,
is, in itself, indestructible, imperishable and immortal.</p>

<p>Consider, then, this race, which is of such recent introduction
upon the stage of the European world, of such a singular
origin and history, and of such universal existence,
with such a prejudice existing against it, and the merest
impulse of reflection, apart from the facts of the case, will
lead us to conclude, that, as it has settled, it has remained
true to itself, in the various associations of life. In whatever
position, or under whatever circumstances, it is to be
found, it may be compared, in reference to its past history,
to a chain, and the early Gipsies, to those who have charged
it with electricity. However mixed, or however polished,
the metal of the links may have since become, they have always
served to convey the Gipsy fluid to every generation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
of the race. It is even unnecessary to enquire, particularly,
how that has been accomplished, for it is self-evident that
the process which has linked other races to their ancestry,
has doubly linked the Gipsy race to theirs. Indeed, the
idea of being Gipsies never can leave the Gipsy race. A
Gipsy&#8217;s life is like a continual conspiracy towards the rest
of the world; he has always a secret upon his mind, and,
from his childhood to his old age, he is so placed as if he
were, in a negative sense, engaged in some gunpowder plot,
or as if he had committed a crime, let his character be as
good as it possibly may. Into whatever company he may
enter, he naturally remarks to himself: &#8220;I wonder if there
are any of us here.&#8221; That is the position which the mixed
and better kind of Gipsy occupies, generally and passively.
Of course, there are some of the race who are always
actually hatching some plot or other against the rest of the
world. Take a Gipsy of the popular kind, who appears as
such to the world, and there are two ideas constantly before
him&mdash;that of the <i>Gorgio</i> and <i>Chabo</i>: they may slumber
while he is in his house, or in his tent, or when he is asleep,
or his mind is positively occupied with something; but let
any one come near him, or him meet or accost any one, and
he naturally remarks, to himself, that the person &#8220;is <i>not</i> one
of us,&#8221; or that he &#8220;<i>is</i> one of us.&#8221; He knows well what the
native may be thinking or saying of him, and he as naturally
responds in his own mind. This circumstance of itself, this
frightful prejudice against the individual, makes, or at least
keeps, the Gipsy wild; it calls forth the passion of resentment,
and produces a feeling of reckless abandon, that might
otherwise leave him. To that is to be added the feeling, in
the Gipsy&#8217;s mind, of his race having been persecuted, for he
knows little of the circumstances attending the origin of the
laws passed against his tribe, and attributes them to persecution
alone. He considers that he has a right to travel;
that he has been deprived of rights to travel, which were
granted to his tribe by the monarchs of past ages; and,
moreover, that his ancestors&mdash;the &#8220;ancient wandering Egyptians&#8221;&mdash;always
travelled. He feels perfectly independent of,
and snaps his fingers at, everybody; and entertains a profound
suspicion of any one who may approach him, inasmuch
as he imagines that the stranger, however fair he may speak
to him, has that feeling for him, as if he considered it pollution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
to touch him. But he is very civil and plausible when
he is at home.</p>

<p>It is from such material that all kinds of settled Gipsies,
at one time or other, have sprung. Such is the prejudice
against the race, that, if they did not hide the fact of their
being Gipsies from the ordinary natives, they would hardly
have the &#8220;life of a dog&#8221; among them, because of their having
sprung from a race which, in its original state, has been
persecuted, and so much despised. By settling in life, and
conforming with the ways of the rest of the community, they
&#8220;cease to be Gipsies,&#8221; in the estimation of the world; for
the world imagines that, when the Gipsy conforms to its
ways, there is an end of his being a Gipsy. Barring the
&#8220;habits,&#8221; such a Gipsy is as much a Gipsy as before, although
he is one <i>incog</i>. The wonder is not that he and his
descendants should be Gipsies; but the real wonder is, that
they should not be Gipsies. Neither he nor his descendants
have any choice in the matter. Does the settled Gipsy keep
a crockery or tin establishment, or an inn, or follow any
other occupation? Then his children cannot all follow the
same calling; they must betake themselves to the various
employments open to the community at large, and, their
blood being mixed, they become lost to the general eye,
amid the rest of the population. While this process is
gradually going on, the Gipsy population which always remains
in the tent&mdash;the hive from which the tribe swarms&mdash;attracts
the attention of the public, and prevents it from
thinking anything about the matter. In England, alone, we
may safely assume that the tented Gipsy population, about
the commencement of this century, must have encreased at
least four-fold by this time, while, to the eye of the public, it
would appear that &#8220;the Gipsies are gradually decreasing, so
that, by and by, they will become extinct.&#8221;</p>

<p>The world, generally, has never even thought about this
subject. When I have spoken to people promiscuously in
regard to it, they have replied: &#8220;We suppose that the Gipsies,
as they have settled in life, have got lost among the
general population:&#8221; than which nothing can be more unfounded,
as a matter of fact, or ridiculous, as a matter of
theory. Imagine a German family settling in Scotland.
The feeling of being Germans becomes lost in the first generation,
who do not, perhaps, speak a word of German.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
There is no prejudice entertained for the family, but, on the
contrary, much good-will and respect are shown it by its
neighbours. The parents identify themselves with those
surrounding them; the children, born in the country, become,
or rather are, Scotch altogether; so that all that remains
is the sense of a German extraction, which, but for
the name of the family, would very soon be lost, or become
a mere matter of tradition. In every other respect, the family,
sooner or later, becomes lost amid the general population.
In America, we daily see Germans getting mixed with, and
lost among, Americans; but where is the evidence of such
a process going on, or ever having taken place, in Great
Britain, between the Gipsy and the native races? The
prejudice which the ordinary natives have for the very name
of Gipsy is sufficient proof that the Gipsy tribe has not been
lost in any such manner. Still, it has not only got mixed,
but &#8220;dreadfully mixed,&#8221; with the native blood; but it
has worked up the additional blood within itself, having
thoroughly gipsyfied it. The original Gipsy blood may be
compared to liquid in a vessel, into which native liquid has
been put: the mixture has, as a natural consequence, lost,
in a very great measure, its original colour; but, inasmuch
as the most important element in the amalgamation has been
<i>mind</i>, the result is, that, in its descent, it has remained, as
before, Gipsy. Instead, therefore, of the Gipsies having
become lost among the native population, a certain part of
the native blood has been lost among them, greatly adding
to the number of the body.</p>

<p>We cannot institute any comparison between the introduction
of the Gipsies and the Huguenots, the last body of
foreigners that entered Great Britain, relative to the destiny
of the respective foreign elements. For the Huguenots were
not a race, as distinguished from every other creature in the
world, but a religious party, taking refuge among a people
of cognate blood and language, and congenial religious feelings
and faith; and were, to say the least of it, on a par, in
every respect, with the ordinary natives, with nothing connected
with them to prevent an amalgamation with the
other inhabitants; but, on the contrary, having this characteristic,
in common with the nations of Europe, that the
place of birth constitutes the fact, and, taken in connection
with the residence, creates the feelings of nationality and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
race. Many of my readers are, doubtless, conversant with
the history of the Huguenots. Even in some parts of
America, nothing is more common than for people to say
that they are Huguenots, that is, of Huguenot descent,
which is very commonly made the foundation of the connections
and intimate associations of life. The peculiarity
is frequently shown in the appearance of the individuals, and
in such mental traits as spring from the contemplation of
the Huguenots as an historical and religious party, even
when the individual now follows the Catholic faith. But
these people differ in no essential respect from the other
inhabitants.</p>

<p>But how different is the position always occupied by the
Gipsies! Well may they consider themselves &#8220;strangers
in the land;&#8221; for by whom have they ever been acknowledged?
They entered Scotland, for example, and have
encreased, progressed, and developed, with so great a prejudice
against them, and so separated in their feelings from
others around them, as if none had almost existed in the
country but themselves, while they were &#8220;dwelling in the
midst of their brethren;&#8221; the native blood that has been
incorporated with them having the appearance as if it had
come from abroad. They, a people distinct from any other
in the world, have sprung from the most primitive stage of
human existence&mdash;the tent, and their knowledge of their
race goes no further back than when it existed in other
parts of the world, in the same condition, more or less, as
themselves. They have been a migratory tribe, wherever
they have appeared or settled, and have never ceased to be
the same peculiar race, notwithstanding the changes which
they have undergone; and have been at home wherever they
have found themselves placed. The mere place of birth, or
the circumstance under which the individual has been
reared, has had no effect upon their special nationality,
although, as citizens of particular countries, they have assimilated,
in their general ideas, with others around them.
And not only have they had a language peculiar to themselves,
but signs as exclusively theirs as are those of Freemasons.
For Gipsies stand to Gipsies as Freemasons to
Freemasons; with this difference&mdash;that Masons are bound to
respond to and help each other, while such associations,
among the Gipsies, are optional with the individual, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
however, is persuaded that the same people, with these exclusive
peculiarities, are to be met with in every part of the
world. A Gipsy is, in his way, a Mason born, and, from his
infancy, is taught to hide everything connected with his race,
from those around him. He is his own <i>tyler</i>, and <i>tyles</i> his
lips continually. Imagine, then, a person taught, from his
infancy, to understand that he is a Gipsy; that his blood, (at
least part of it,) is Gipsy; that he has been instructed in the
language, and initiated in all the mysteries, of the Gipsies;
that his relations and acquaintances in the tribe have undergone
the same experience; that the utmost reserve towards
those who are not Gipsies has been continually inculcated
upon him, and as often practised before his eyes; and what
must be the leading idea, in that person&#8217;s mind, but that he
is a Gipsy? His pedigree is Gipsy, his mind has been cast
in a Gipsy mould, and he can no more &#8220;cease to be a Gipsy&#8221;
than perform any other impossibility in nature. Thus it is
that Gipsydom is not a work of man&#8217;s hand, nor a creed,
that is &#8220;revealed from faith to faith;&#8221; but a work which has
been written by the hand of God upon the heart of a family
of mankind, and is reflected from the mind of one generation
to that of another. It enters into the feelings of the very
existence of the man, and such is the prejudice against his
race, on the part of the ordinary natives, that the better
kind of Scottish Gipsy feels that he, and more particularly
she, would almost be &#8220;torn in pieces,&#8221; if the public really
knew all about them.</p>

<p>These facts will sufficiently illustrate how a people, &#8220;resembling,
in so many respects, the Jews, without having any
territory, or form of creed, peculiar to itself, or any history,
or any peculiar outward associations or residences, or any
material difference in appearance, character, or occupation,&#8221;
can be a people, living among other people, and yet be distinct
from those among whom they live. The distinction
consists in this people having <i>blood</i>, <i>language</i>, a <i>cast of mind</i>,
and <i>signs</i>, peculiar to itself; the three first being the only
elements which distinguish races; for religion is a secondary
consideration; one religion being common to many distinct
races. This principle, which is more commonly applied to
people occupying different countries, is equally applicable to
races, clans, families, or individuals, living within the
boundary of a particular country, or dwelling in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
community. We can easily understand how two individuals
can be two distinct individuals, notwithstanding their being
members of the same family, and professing the same religion.
We can still more easily understand the same of two families,
and still more so of two septs or clans of the same general
race. And, surely, there can be no difficulty in understanding
that the Gipsy tribe, whatever may be its habits, is
something different from any native tribe: for it has never
yet found rest for the sole of its foot among the native race,
although it has secured a shelter clandestinely; and of the
extent, and especially of the nature, of its existence, the
world may be said to be entirely ignorant. The position
which the Gipsy race occupies in Scotland is that which it
substantially occupies in every other country&mdash;unacknowledged,
and, in a sense, damned, everywhere. There is, therefore,
no wonder that it should remain a distinct family
among mankind, cemented by its language and signs, and
the knowledge of its universality. The phenomenon rests
upon purely natural causes, and differs considerably from
that of the existence of the Jews. For the Jews are, everywhere,
acknowledged by the world, after a sort; they have
neither language nor, as far as I know, signs peculiar to
themselves, (although there are secret orders among them,)
but possess the most ancient history, an original country, to
which they, more or less, believe they will be restored, and
a religion of divine origin, but utterly superseded by a
new and better dispensation. Notwithstanding all that, the
following remark, relative to the existence of the Jews, since
the dispersion, may very safely be recalled: &#8220;The philosophical
historian confesses that he has no place for it in all
his generalizations, and refers it to the mysteries of Providence.&#8221;
For the history of the Gipsies bears a very great
resemblance to it; and, inasmuch as that is not altogether
&#8220;the device of men&#8217;s hands,&#8221; it must, also, be referred to
Providence, for Providence has a hand in everything.</p>

<p>It is very true that the &#8220;philosophical historian has no
place, in all his generalizations, for the phenomenon of the
existence of the Jews, since the dispersion,&#8221; for he has never
investigated the subject inductively, and on its own merits.
It is poor logic to assert that, because the American Indians
are, to a great extent, and will soon be, extinct, therefore
the existence of the Jews, to-day, is a miracle. And it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
be nearly as poor logic to maintain the same of the Jews in
connection with any of the ancient and extinct nations.
There is no analogy between the history of the Jews, since
the dispersion, and that of any other people, (excepting the
Gipsies;) and, consequently, no comparison can be instituted
between them.<a name="FNanchor299" id="FNanchor299"></a><a href="#Footnote299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> Before asking how it is that the Jews exist
to-day, it would be well to enquire by what possible process
they could cease to be Jews. And by what human means
the Jews, as a people, or even as individuals, will receive
Christ as their Messiah, and thereby become Christian
Jews. This idea of the Jews existing by a miracle has
been carried to a very great length, as the following quotation,
from an excellent writer, on the Evidences of Christianity,
will show: &#8220;What is this,&#8221; says he, &#8220;but a miracle?
connected with the prophecy which it fulfills, it is a double
miracle. Whether testimony can ever establish the credibility
of a miracle is of no importance here. This one is
obvious to every man&#8217;s senses. All nations are its eye-witnesses. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The laws of nature have been suspended
in their case.&#8221; This writer, in a spirit of gambling, stakes
the whole question of revelation upon his own dogma; and,
according to his hypothesis, loses it. The laws of nature
would, indeed, have been suspended, in their case, and a
miracle would, indeed, have been wrought, if the Jews had
ceased to be Jews, or had become anything else than what
they are to-day. Writers on the Christian Evidences should
content themselves with maintaining that the Jews have
fulfilled the prophecies, and will yet fulfill them, and assert
nothing further of them.</p>

<p>The writer alluded to compares the history of the Jews,
since the dispersion, to the following phenomenon: &#8220;A
mighty river, having plunged, from a mountain height, into
the depths of the ocean, and been separated into its component
drops, and thus scattered to the ends of the world,
and blown about, by all winds, during almost eighteen centuries,
is still capable of being disunited from the waters of
the ocean; its minutest drops, never having been assimilated
to any other, are still distinct, unchanged, and ready to be
gathered.&#8221; Such language cannot be applied to the Jews;
for the philosophy of their existence, to-day, is so very simple
in its nature, as to have escaped the observation of mankind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
I will give it further on in this <a href="#Page_371">Disquisition</a>. The
language in question is somewhat applicable to the Gipsies,
for they have become <i>worked into</i> all other nations, in regard
to blood and language, and are &#8220;still distinct and
unchanged,&#8221; as to their being Gipsies, whatever their habits
may be; and, although there is no occasion for them to be
&#8220;gathered,&#8221; they would yet, outwardly or inwardly, heartily
respond to any call addressed to them.<a name="FNanchor300" id="FNanchor300"></a><a href="#Footnote300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>There is, as I have already said, no real outward difference
between many settled and educated Scottish Gipsies and
ordinary natives; for such Gipsies are as likely to have fair
hair and blue eyes, as black. Their characters and occupations
may be the same; they may have intimate associations
together; may be engaged in business as partners; may
even be cousins, nay, half-brothers. But let them, on
separate occasions, enter a company of Gipsies, and the reception
shown to them will mark the difference in the two
individuals. The difference between two such Scotchmen,
(for they really are both Scotch,) the reader may remark,
makes the Gipsy only a Gipsy nominally, which, outwardly,
he is; but he is still a Gipsy, although, in point of colour,
character, or condition, not one of the old stock; for he has
&#8220;the blood,&#8221; and has been reared and instructed as a Gipsy.
But such a Gipsy is not fond of entering a company of Gipsies,
strangers to him, unless introduced by a friend in whom
he has confidence, for he is afraid of being known to be a
Gipsy. He is more apt to visit some of the more original
kind of the race, where he is not known. On sitting down
beside them, with a friendly air, they will be sure to treat
him kindly, not knowing but that they may be entertaining
a Gipsy unawares; for such original Gipsies, believing that
&#8220;the blood&#8221; is to be found well up in life, feel very curious
when they meet with such a person. If he &#8220;lets out&#8221; an
idea in regard to the race, and expresses a kindly feeling
towards &#8220;the blood,&#8221; the suspicions of his friends are at
once excited, so that, if he, in an equivocal manner, remarks
that he is &#8220;<i>not</i> one of them,&#8221; hesitates, stammers, and protests
that he really is not one of them, they will as readily
swear that he <i>is</i> one of them; for well does the blackguard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
Gipsy, (as the world calls him,) know the delicacy of such
settled and educated Gipsies in owning the blood. There
is less suspicion shown, on such occasions, when the settled
Gipsy is Scotch, and the <i>bush</i> Gipsy English; and particularly
so should the occasion be in America; for, when they meet in
America, away from the peculiar relations under which they
have been reared, and where they can &#8220;breathe,&#8221; as they express
it, the respective classes are not so suspicious of each other.</p>

<p>Besides the difference just drawn between the Gipsy and
ordinary native&mdash;that of recognizing and being recognized
by another Gipsy&mdash;I may mention the following general
distinction between them. The ordinary Scot knows that
he is a Scot, and nothing more, unless it be something about
his ancestors of two or three generations. But the Gipsy&#8217;s
idea of Scotland goes back to a certain time, indefinite to
him, as it may be, beyond which his race had no existence
in the country. Where his ancestors sojourned, immediately,
or at any time, before they entered Scotland, he cannot tell;
but this much he knows of them, that they are neither Scottish
nor European, but that they came from the East. The
fact of his blood being mixed exercises little or no influence
over his feelings relative to his tribe, for, mixed as it may
be, he knows that he is one of the tribe, and that the origin
of his tribe is his origin. In a word, he knows that he has
sprung from the tent. Substitute the word Scotch for Moor,
as related of the black African Gipsies, at <a href="#Page_429">page 429</a>, and he
may say of himself and tribe: &#8220;We are not Scotch, but can
give no account of ourselves.&#8221; It is a little different, if the
mixture of his blood is of such recent date as to connect him
with native families; in that case, he has &#8220;various bloods&#8221;
to contend for, should they be assailed; but his Gipsy blood,
as a matter of course, takes precedence. By marrying into
the tribe, the connection with such native families gradually
drops out of the memory of his descendants, and leaves the
sensation of tribe exclusively Gipsy. Imagine, then, that
the Gipsy has been reared a Gipsy, in the way so frequently
described, and that he &#8220;knows all about the Gipsies,&#8221; while
the ordinary native knows really nothing about them; and
we have a general idea of what a Scottish Gipsy is, as distinguished
from an ordinary Scotchman. If we admit that
every native Scot knows who he is, we may readily assume
that every Scottish Gipsy knows who <i>he</i> is. But, to place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
the point of difference in a more striking light, it may be
remarked, that the native Scot will instinctively exclaim,
that &#8220;the present work has no earthly relation either to
him or his folk;&#8221; while the Scottish Gipsy will as instinctively
exclaim: &#8220;It&#8217;s us, there&#8217;s no mistake about it;&#8221; and
will doubtless accept it, in the main, with a high degree of
satisfaction, as the history of his race, and give it to his
children as such.</p>

<p>A respectable, indeed, any kind of, Scottish Gipsy does
not contemplate his ancestors&mdash;the &#8220;Pilgrim Fathers,&#8221; and
&#8220;Pilgrim Mothers,&#8221; too&mdash;as robbers, although he could do
that with as much grace as any Highland or Border Scot,
but as a singular people, who doubtless came from the Pyramids;
and their language, as something about which he
really does not know what to think; whether it is Egyptian,
Sanscrit, or what it is. Still, he has part of it; he loves it;
and no human power can tear it out of his heart. He knows
that every intelligent being sticks to his own, and clings to
his descent; and he considers it his highest pride to be an
Egyptian&mdash;a descendant of those swarthy kings and queens,
princes and princesses, priests and priestesses, and, of course,
thieves and thievesses, that, like an apparition, found their
way into, and, after wandering about, settled down in, Scotland.
Indeed, he never knew anything else than that he
was an Egyptian; for it is in his blood; and, what is more,
it is in his heart, so that he cannot forget it, unless he should
lose his faculties and become an idiot; and then he would
be an Egyptian idiot. How like a Gipsy it was for Mrs.
Fall, of Dunbar, to &#8220;work in tapestry the principal events
in the life of the founder of her family, from the day the
Gipsy child came to Dunbar, in its mother&#8217;s creel, until the
same Gipsy child had become, by its own honourable exertions,
the head of the first mercantile establishment then
existing in Scotland.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Scottish Gipsies, when their appearance has been
modified by a mixture of the white blood, have possessed, in
common with the Highlanders, the faculty of &#8220;getting out&#8221;
of the original ways of their race, and becoming superior in
character, notwithstanding the excessive prejudice that
exists against the nation of which they hold themselves
members. Except his strong partiality for his blood and
tribe, language, and signs, such a Gipsy becomes, in his general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
disposition and ways, like any ordinary native. It is
impossible that it should be otherwise. Whenever a Gipsy,
then, forsakes his original habits, and conforms with the
ways of the other inhabitants, he becomes, for all practical
purposes, an ordinary citizen of the Gipsy clan. If he is a
man of good natural abilities, the original wild ambition of
his race acquires a new turn; and his capacity fits him for
any occupation. Priding himself on being an Egyptian, a
member of this world-wide community, he acquires, as he
gains information, a spirit of liberality of sentiment; he
reads history, and perceives that every family of mankind
has not only been barbarous, but very barbarous, at one
time; and, from such reflections, he comes to consider his
own origin, and very readily becomes confirmed in his early,
but indistinct, ideas of his people, that they really are somebody.
Indeed, he considers himself not only as good, but
better than other people. His being forced to assume an
incognito, and &#8220;keep as quiet as pussy,&#8221; chafes his proud
spirit, but it does not render him gloomy, for his natural
disposition is too buoyant for that. How, then, does such a
Scottish Gipsy feel in regard to his ancestors? He feels
exactly as Highlanders do, in regard to theirs, or, as the
Scottish Borderers do, with reference to the &#8220;Border Ruffians,&#8221;
as I have heard a Gipsy term them. Indeed, the gallows
of Perth and Stirling, Carlisle and Jedburgh, could tell
some fine tales of many respectable Scottish people, in times
that are past.</p>

<p>The children of such a Gipsy differ very much from those
of the same race in their natural state, although they may
have the same amount of blood, and the same eye. The eye
of the former is subdued, for his passions, in regard to his
race, have never been called forth; while the eye of the latter
rolls about, as if he were conscious that every one he
meets with is remarking of him, &#8220;There goes a vagabond of
a Gipsy.&#8221; Two fine specimens of the former kind of Gipsies
attended the High School of Edinburgh, when I was at that institution.
Hearing the family frequently spoken of at home, my
attention was often taken up with the boys, without understanding
what a Gipsy of <i>that</i> kind could mean; although I
had a pretty good idea of the common Gipsy, or Tinkler, as
he is generally called in Scotland. These two young Gipsies
were what might be called sweet youths; modest and shy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
among the other boys, as young tamed wild turkeys; very
dark in colour, with an eye that could be caught in whatever
way I might look at them. They now occupy very
honourable positions in life. There were other Gipsies at the
High School, at this time, but they were of the &#8220;brown sort.&#8221;
I have met, in the United States, with a Scottish Gipsy,
taking greatly after the Gipsy, in his appearance; a man
very gentlemanly in his manner and bearing, and as
neat and trim as if he had &#8220;come out of a box.&#8221; It is natural,
indeed, to suppose that there must be a great difference,
in many respects, between a wild, original Gipsy,
and one of the tame and educated kind, whose descent
is several, perhaps many, generations from the tent. In
the houses of the former, things are generally found lying
about, here-away, there-away, as if they were just going
to be taken out and placed in the waggon, or on the ass&#8217;s
back.</p>

<p>It is certainly a singular position which is occupied, from
generation to generation, and century to century, by our settled
Scottish, as well as other, Gipsies, who are not known
to the world as such, yet maintain a daily intercourse with
others not of their own tribe. It resembles a state of semi-damnation,
with a drawn sword hanging over their heads,
ready to fall upon them at any moment. But the matter
cannot be mended. They are Gipsies, by every physical and
mental necessity, and they accommodate themselves to their
circumstances as they best may. This much is certain, that
they have the utmost confidence in their incognito, as regards
their descent, personal feelings, and exclusively private associations.
The word &#8220;Gipsy,&#8221; to be applied to them by
strangers, frightens them, in contemplation, far more than
it does the children of the ordinary natives; for they imagine
it a dreadful thing to be known to their neighbours as Gipsies.
Still, they have never occupied any other position;
they have been born in it, and reared in it; it has even
been the nature of the race, from the very first, always to
&#8220;work in the dark.&#8221; In all probability, it has never occurred
to them to imagine that it will ever be otherwise:
nor do they evidently wish it; for they can see no possible
way to have themselves acknowledged, by the world, as
Gipsies. The very idea horrifies them. So far from letting
the world know anything of them, as Gipsies, their constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
care is to keep it in perpetual darkness on the subject. Of
all men, these Gipsies may say:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;&nbsp;<span class="padl1">.</span><span class="padl1">.</span><span class="padl1">.</span><span class="padl1">.</span><span class="padl1">.</span><span class="padl1">.</span> rather bear those ills we have,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than fly to others we know not of.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Indeed, the only thing that worries such a Gipsy is the
idea that the public should know all about <i>him</i>; otherwise,
he feels a supreme satisfaction in being a Gipsy; as well as
in having such a history of his race as I have informed him
I proposed publishing, provided I do not in any way mix <i>him</i>
up with it, or &#8220;let <i>him</i> out.&#8221; By bringing up the body in the
manner done in this work, by making a sweep of the whole
tribe, the responsibility becomes spread over a large number
of people; so that, should the Gipsy become, by any means,
known, personally, to the world, he would have the satisfaction
of knowing that he had others to keep him company;
men occupying respectable positions in life, and respected, by
the world at large, as individuals.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have one of the principal reasons for
everything connected with the Gipsies being hidden from
the rest of mankind. They have always been looked upon
as arrant vagabonds, while they have looked upon their ancestors
as illustrious and immortal heroes. How, then, are
we to bridge over this gulf that separates them, in feeling,
from the rest of the world? The natural reply is, that
we should judge them, not by their condition and character
in times that are past, but by what they are to-day.</p>

<p>That the Gipsies were a barbarous race when they entered
Europe, in the beginning of the fifteenth century, is just what
could have been expected of any Asiatic, migratory, tented
horde, at a time when the inhabitants of Europe were little
better than barbarous, themselves, and many of them absolutely
so. To speak of the Highland clans, at that time, as
being better than barbarous, would be out of the question;
as to the Irish people, it would be difficult to say what they
really were, at the same time. Even the Lowland Scotch, a
hundred years after the arrival of the Gipsies in Europe,
were, with some exceptions, divided into two classes&mdash;&#8220;beggars
and rascals,&#8221; as history tells us. Is it, therefore, unreasonable
to say, that, in treating of the Gipsies of to-day,
we should apply to them the same principles of judgment
that have been applied to the ordinary natives? If we refer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
to the treaty between John Faw and James V., in 1540, we
will very readily conclude that, three centuries ago, the
leaders of the Gipsies were very superior men, in their way;
cunning, astute, and slippery Oriental barbarians, with the
experience of upwards of a century in European society
generally; well up to the ways of the world, and the general
ways of Church and State; and, in a sense, at home with
kings, popes, cardinals, nobility, and gentry. That was the
character of a superior Gipsy, in 1540. In 1840, we find
the race represented by as fine a man as ever graced the
Church of Scotland. &#8220;Grand was the repose of his lofty
brow, dark eye, and aspect of soft and melancholy meaning.
It was a face from which every evil and earthly passion
seemed purged. A deep gravity lay upon his countenance,
which had the solemnity, without the sternness, of one of
our old reformers. You could almost fancy a halo completing
its apostolic character.&#8221; Some of the Scottish Gipsies
of to-day could very readily exclaim:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;And, if thou said&#8217;st I am not peer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To any <i>one</i> in Scotland here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Highland or Lowland, far or near,<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Oh, Donald</i>, thou hast lied!&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But it is impossible for any one to give an account of the
Gipsies in Scotland, from the year 1506, down to the present
time. This much, however, can be said of them, that they
are as much Gipsies now as ever they were; that is, the
Gipsies of to-day are the representatives of the race as it appeared
in Scotland three centuries and a half ago, and hold
themselves to be Gipsies now, as, indeed, they always will do.</p>

<p>Ever since the race entered Scotland, we may reasonably
assume that it has been dropping out of the tent into settled
life, in one form or other, and sometimes to a greater extent
at one time than another. It never has been a nomadic race,
in the proper sense of the word; for a nomad is one who
possesses flocks and herds, with which he moves about from
pasturage to pasturage, as he does in Asia to-day. Mr.
Borrow says that there are Gipsies who follow this kind of
life, in Russia; but that, doubtless, arises from the circumstances
in which they have found themselves placed.<a name="FNanchor301" id="FNanchor301"></a><a href="#Footnote301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> &#8220;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
think,&#8221; said an English Gipsy to me, &#8220;that we must take
partly of the ancient Egyptians, and partly of the Arabs;
from the Egyptians, owing to our settled ways, and from the
Arabs, owing to our wandering habits.&#8221; Upon entering
Europe, they must have wandered about promiscuously, for
some short time, before pitching upon territories, which they
would divide among themselves, under their kings and chieftains.
Here we find the proper sphere of the Gipsy, in his
original state. In 1506, Anthonius Gawino is represented, by
James IV., to his uncle, the king of Denmark, as having
&#8220;sojourned in Scotland in peaceable and catholic manner:&#8221;
and John Faw, by James V., in 1540, during his &#8220;pilgrimage,&#8221;
as &#8220;doing a lawful business;&#8221; which evidently had
some meaning, as we find that seven pounds were paid to the
Egyptians by the king&#8217;s chamberlain. In 1496, the Gipsies
made musket-balls for the king of Hungary; and, in 1565,
cannon-balls for the Turks. In short, they were travelling
smiths, or what has since been called tinkers, with a turn for
any kind of ordinary mechanical employment, and particularly
as regards working in metals; dealers in animals, petty
traders, musicians, and fortune-tellers, with a wonderful
knack for &#8220;transferring money from other people&#8217;s pockets
into their own;&#8221; living representatively, but apparently not
wholly, in tents, and &#8220;helping themselves&#8221; to whatever they
stood in need of.<a name="FNanchor302" id="FNanchor302"></a><a href="#Footnote302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>Speaking of the Gipsy chiefs mentioned in the act of James
V., our author, as we have seen, very justly remarks: &#8220;It
cannot be supposed that the ministers of three or four succeeding
monarchs would have suffered their sovereigns to
be so much imposed on, as to allow them to put their names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
to public documents styling poor and miserable wretches, as
we at the present day imagine them to have been, &#8216;Lords
and Earls of Little Egypt.&#8217;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am disposed
to believe that Anthonius Gawino, in 1506, and John Faw, in
1540, would personally, as individuals, that is, as Gipsy
rajahs, have a very respectable and imposing appearance, in
the eyes of the officers of the crown.&#8221; (<a href="#Page_108">Page 108</a>.)<a name="FNanchor303" id="FNanchor303"></a><a href="#Footnote303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> We
have likewise seen how many laws were passed, by the Scots
parliament, against &#8220;great numbers of his majesty&#8217;s subjects,
of whom some outwardly pretend to be famous and unspotted
gentlemen,&#8221; for encouraging and supporting the Gipsies;
and, in the case of William Auchterlony, of Cayrine, for receiving
into their houses, and feasting them, their wives,
children, <i>servants</i>, and companies. All this took place
more than a hundred years after the arrival of the Gipsies in
Scotland, and seventy-six years after the date of the treaty
between James V. and John Faw. We can very readily
believe that the sagacity displayed by this chief and his
folk, to evade the demand made upon them to leave the
country, was likewise employed to secure their perpetual
existence in it; for, from the first, their intention was evidently
to possess it. Hence their original story of being
pilgrims, which would prevent the authorities from disturbing
them, but which had no effect upon Henry VIII., whom,
of all the monarchs of Europe, they did not hoax. Grellmann
mentions their having obtained passports from the
Emperor Sigismund, and other princes, as well as from the
king of France, and the Pope.</p>

<p>Entering Scotland with the firm determination to &#8220;possess&#8221;
the country, the Gipsies would, from the very first,
direct their attention towards its occupation, and draw into
their body much of the native blood, in the way which I
have already described. And there was certainly a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
floating population in the country, from which to draw it.
It would little consist with the feelings of Highland or Lowland
outlaws to exist without female society; nor was that
female society easily to be found, apart from some kind of
settled life; hence, in seeking for a home, which is inseparable
from the society of a female, our native outlaw would
very naturally and readily &#8220;haul up&#8221; with the Gipsy woman;
for, being herself quite &#8220;at home,&#8221; in her tent, she would
present just the desideratum which the other was in quest
of. For, although &#8220;Gipsies marry with Gipsies,&#8221; it is only
as a rule, the exceptions being many, and, in all probability,
much more common, in the early stage of their European
history. The present &#8220;dreadfully mixed&#8221; state of Gipsydom
is a sufficient proof of this fact. The aversion, on the
part of the Gipsy, to intermarry with the ordinary natives,
proceeds, in the first place, from the feelings which the natives
entertain for her race. Remove those feelings, and the
Gipsies, as a body, would still marry among themselves; for
their pride in their peculiar sept, and a natural jealousy of
those outside of their mystic circle, would, alone, keep the
world from penetrating their secrets, without its being extended
to him who, by intermarriage, became &#8220;one of them.&#8221;
There is no other obstacle in the way of marriages between
the two races, excepting the general one, on the part of the
Gipsies, and which is inherent in them, to preserve themselves
as a branch of a people to be found in every country.
Admitting the general aversion, on the part of the Gipsies,
to <i>marry</i> with natives, and we at once see the unlikelihood
of their women <i>playing the wanton</i> with them. Still, it is
very probable that they, in some instances, bore children to
some of the &#8220;unspotted gentlemen,&#8221; mentioned, by act of
parliament, as having so greatly protected and entertained
the tribe. Such illegitimate children would be put to good
service by the Gipsy chiefs. By one means or other, there
is no doubt but the Gipsies made a dead-set upon certain
native families of influence. The capacity that could devise
such a scheme for remaining in the country, as is contained
in the act of 1540, and influence the courts of the regency,
and of Queen Mary, to reinstate them in their old position,
after the severe order of 1541, proclaiming banishment
within thirty days, and death thereafter, even when the
&#8220;lords understood, perfectly, the great thefts and <i>skaiths</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
(damages,) done by the said Egyptians,&#8221; could easily execute
plans to secure a hold upon private families. If to all this
we add the very nature of Gipsydom; how it always remains
true to itself, as it gets mixed with the native blood; how it
works its way up in the world; and how its members &#8220;stick
to each other;&#8221; we can readily understand how the tribe
acquired important and influential friends in high places.
Do not speak of the attachment of the Jewess to her people:
that of the Gipsy is greater. A Jewess passes current, anywhere,
as a Jewess; but the Gipsy, as she gets connected
with a native circle, and moves about in the world, does so
clandestinely, for, as a Gipsy, she is <i>incog.</i>; so that her attachment
remains, at heart, with her tribe, and is all the
stronger, from the feelings that are peculiar to her singularly
wild descent. I am very much inclined to think that Mrs.
Baillie, of Lamington, mentioned under the head of Tweed-dale
and Clydesdale Gipsies, was a Gipsy; and the more so,
from having learned, from two different sources, that the
present Baillie, of &mdash;&mdash;, is a Gipsy. Considering that
courts of justice have always stretched a point, to convict,
and <i>execute</i>, Gipsies, it looks like something very singular, that
William Baillie, a Gipsy, who was condemned to death, in
1714, should have had his sentence commuted to banishment,
<i>and been allowed to go at large</i>, while others, condemned with
him, were executed. And three times did he escape in that
manner, till, at last, he was slain by one of his tribe. It
also seems very singular, that James Baillie, another Gipsy,
in 1772, should have been condemned for the murder of his
wife, and, also, had his sentence commuted to banishment,
and been allowed to go at large: and that twice, at least.
Well might McLaurin remark: &#8220;Few cases have occurred
in which there has been such an expenditure of mercy.&#8221;
And tradition states that &#8220;the then Mistress Baillie, of
Lamington, and her family, used all their interest in obtaining
these pardons for James Baillie.&#8221; No doubt of it. But
the reason for all this was, doubtless, different from that of
&#8220;James Baillie, like his fathers before him, <i>pretending</i> that
he was a bastard relative of the family of Lamington.&#8221;</p>

<p>A somewhat similar case of pardoning Gipsies is related
by a writer in Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine, as having occurred
towards the end of last century; the individual procuring
the pardon being the excitable Duchess of Gordon, the same,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
I presume, whom Burns&#8217; genius &#8220;fairly lifted off her feet.&#8221;
The following are the circumstances, as given by this writer:
A Berwickshire farmer had been missing sheep, and lay in
wait, one night, with a servant, for the depredators. They
seized upon Tam Gordon, the captain of the Spittal Gipsies,
and his son-in-law, Ananias Faa, in the very act of stealing
the sheep; when the captain drew a knife, to defend himself.
They were convicted and condemned for the crime;
&#8220;but afterwards, to the great surprise of their Berwickshire
neighbours, obtained a pardon, a piece of unmerited and ill-bestowed
clemency, for which, it was generally understood,
they were indebted to the interest of a noble northern family,
of their own name. We recollect hearing a sort of ballad
upon Tam&#8217;s exploits, and his deliverance from the gallows,
through the intercession of a celebrated duchess, but do not
recollect any of the words.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor304" id="FNanchor304"></a><a href="#Footnote304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>A transaction like this must strike the reader as something
very remarkable. Sheep-stealing, at the time mentioned,
was a capital offence, for which there was almost no
pardon; and more especially in the case of people who were
of notorious &#8220;habit and repute Gipsies,&#8221; caught in the very
act, which was aggravated by their drawing an &#8220;invasive
weapon.&#8221; Not only were they condemned, but we may
readily assume that the &#8220;country-side&#8221; were crying, &#8220;Hang
and bury the vagabonds;&#8221; and death seemed certain; when
in steps the duchess, and snatches them both from the very
teeth of the gallows. What guarantee have we that the
duchess was not a Gipsy? It certainly was not likely that
a Gipsy woman would step out of her tent, and seize a
coronet; but what cannot we imagine to have taken place,
in &#8220;the blood&#8221; working its way up, during the previous 250
years? What guarantee have we that Professor Wilson
was not &#8220;taking a look at the old thing,&#8221; when rambling
with the Gipsies, in his youth? There are Gipsy families in
Edinburgh, to-day, of as respectable standing, and of as good
descent, as could be said of him, or many others who have
distinguished themselves in the world.</p>

<p>We must not forget that, when the Gipsies entered Scotland,
it was for better or for worse, just for what was
to &#8220;turn up.&#8221; Very soon after their arrival, the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
would become their country, as much as that of the ordinary
natives; so that Scotland became their home, as much as if
it had always been that of their race, except their retaining
a tradition of their recent arrival from some part of the
East, and a singular sense of being part and parcel of &#8220;the
Egyptians that were scattered over the face of the earth;&#8221;
neither of which the odious prejudice against &#8220;the blood&#8221;
allowed them to forget; assuming that they were willing,
and, moreover, that the cast of their minds allowed
them, to do either. The idea which has been expressed by
the world, generally, of the Gipsy tribe gradually assimilating
with the native race, and ultimately &#8220;getting lost
among it,&#8221; applies to the principle at issue; for, as I have
already said, it <i>has</i> got greatly lost, in point of appearance,
and general deportment, among the ordinary natives, but has
remained, heart and soul, Gipsy, as before. Even with the
native race, we will find that the blood of the lowly is always
getting mixed with that in the higher circles of life. We
have the case of a girl going to service with a London brewer,
then becoming his wife, then his widow, then employing a
lawyer to manage her affairs, and afterwards marrying him,
who, in his turn, became Earl of Clarendon, and father, by
her, of the queen of James II. Towards the end of last, or
beginning of the present, century, we hear of a poor actress,
who commenced life in a provincial theatre, marrying one
of the Coutts, the bankers, and dying Duchess of St. Albans.
Such events have been of much more common occurrence in
less elevated spheres of life; and the Gipsy race has had its
share of them. For this reason, it is really impossible to
say, who, among the Scotch, are, and who are not, of the
Gipsy tribe; such a thorough mess has the &#8220;mixing of the
blood&#8221; made of the Scottish population. Notwithstanding
all that, there is a certain definite number of &#8220;Gipsies&#8221; in
Scotland, known to God only; while each Gipsy is known
in his or her conscience to belong to the tribe. This
much is certain, that we need not consult the census returns
for the number of the tribe in Scotland. However easy, or
however difficult, it may be, to define what a Gipsy, in regard
to external or internal circumstances, is, this much is
certain, that the feeling in his mind as to his being a Gipsy,
is as genuine and emphatic as is the feeling in the mind of
a Jew being a Jew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>The circumstances connected with the perpetuation of the
Gipsy and Jewish races greatly resemble each other. Both
races are scattered over the face of the earth. The Jew has
had a home; he has a strong attachment to it, and looks
forward to enter it at some future day. The Gipsy may be
said never to have had a home, but is at home everywhere.
&#8220;What part of England did you come from?&#8221; said I to an
English semi-tented Gipsy, in America. &#8220;What <i>part</i> of
England did I come from, did you say? I come from <i>all
over England!</i>&#8221; The Scottish race, as a race, is confined to
people born in Scotland; for the children of expatriated
Scots are not Scotchmen. And so it is with people of other
countries. The mere birth upon the soil constitutes their
race or nationality, although subsequent events, in early life,
may modify the feelings, or draw them into a new channel,
by a change of domicile, in infancy. But the Jew&#8217;s nationality
is everywhere; &#8216;tis in his family, and his associations
with others of his race. Make the acquaintance of the
Jews, and you will find that each generation of them tell
<i>their</i> &#8220;wonderful story&#8221; to the following generation, and
the story is repeated to the following, and the following.
The children of Jews are taught to know they are Jews, before
they can even lisp. Soon do they know that much of
the phenomenon of their race, as regards its origin, its history,
and its universality, to draw the distinction between
them and those around them who are not Jews. Soon do
they learn how their race has been despised and persecuted,
and imbibe the love which their parents have for it, and the
resentment of the odium cast upon it by others. It has been
so from the beginning of their history out of Palestine, and
even while there. Were it only religion, considered in itself,
that has kept the Jews together as a people, they might
have got lost among the rest of mankind; for among the
Jews there are to be found the rankest of infidels; even
Jewish priests will say that, &#8220;it signifies not what a man&#8217;s
religion may be, if he is only sincere in it.&#8221; Is it a feeling,
or a knowledge, of religion that leads a Jewish child, almost
the moment it can speak, to say that it is a Jew? It is
simply the workings of the phenomena of race that account
for this; the religion peculiar to Jews having been introduced
among them centuries after their existence as a
people. Being exclusively theirs in its very nature, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
naturally follow it, as other people do theirs; but, although,
from the nature of its origin, it presents infinitely greater
claims upon their intelligent belief and obedience, they have
yielded no greater submission to its spirit and morals, or
even to its forms, than many other people have done to their
religion, made up, as that has been, of the most fabulous
superstition, on the principle, doubtless, that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;The zealous crowds in ignorance adore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still, the less they know, they fear the more.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Jews being a people before they received the religion
by which they are distinguished, it follows that the religion,
in itself, occupies a position of secondary importance, although
the profession of it acts and reacts upon the people,
in keeping them separate from others. The most, then, that
can be said of the religion of the Jews is, that, following in
the wake of their history as a people, it is only one of the pillars
by which the building is supported.<a name="FNanchor305" id="FNanchor305"></a><a href="#Footnote305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> If enquiry is made
of Jewish converts to Christianity, we will find that, notwithstanding
their having separated from their brethren,
on points of creed, they hold themselves as much Jews as
before. But the conversions of Jews are,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;Like angels&#8217; visits, few and far between.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the case of individuals forsaking the Jewish, and joining
the Christian, Church, that is, believing in the Messiah
having come, instead of to come, it is natural, I may say
inevitable, for them to hold themselves Jews. They have
feelings which the world cannot understand. But beyond
the nationality, physiognomy, and feelings of Jews, there
are no points of difference, and there ought to be no
grounds of offense, between them and the ordinary inhabitants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
While the points of antipathy between the Jew
and Christian rest, not upon race, considered in itself, but
mainly upon religion, and the relations proceeding from it,
it has to be seen what is to be the feeling, on the part of
the world, towards the Gipsy race; such part of it, at least,
whose habits are unexceptionable. This is one of the questions
which it is the object of this <a href="#Page_371">Disquisition</a> to bring to
an issue.</p>

<p>Substitute the language and signs of the Gipsies for the
religion of the Jews, and we find that the rearing of the
Gipsies is almost identical with that of the Jews; and in
the same manner do they hold themselves to be Gipsies.
But the one can be Gipsies, though ignorant of their language
and signs, and the other, Jews, though ignorant of
their religion; the mere sense of tribe and community being
sufficient to constitute them members of their respective
nationalities. The origin of the Gipsies is as distinct from
that of the rest of the world, in three continents, at least,
as is that of the Jews; and, laying aside the matter of religion,
their history, so far as it is known to the world, is as
different. If they have no religion peculiar to themselves,
to assist in holding them together, like the Jews, they have
that which is exclusively theirs&mdash;language and signs; about
which there are no such occasions to quarrel, as in the affair
of a religious creed. Indeed, the Gipsy race stands towards
religions, as the Christian religion does towards races.</p>

<p>People are very apt to speak of the blood of the Jews
being &#8220;purity itself;&#8221; than which nothing is more unfounded.
If a person were asked, What is a pure Jew? he would feel
puzzled to give an intelligent answer to the question. We
know that Abraham and Sarah were the original parents of
the Jewish race, but that much blood has been added to it,
from other sources, ever since. Even four of the patriarchs,
the third in descent from Abraham, were the sons of concubines,
who were, doubtless, bought with money, from the
stranger, (Gen. xvii. 12 and 13,) or the descendants of such,
and were, in all probability, of as different a race from their
mistresses, Leah and Rachel, as was the bondmaid, Hagar,
the Egyptian, from her mistress, Sarah. Joseph married a
daughter of the Egyptian priest of On, and Moses, a daughter
of an Ethiopian priest of Midian. From a circumstance
mentioned in the Exodus, it would appear that Egyptian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
blood, perhaps much of it, had been incorporated with that
of the Jews, while in Egypt.<a name="FNanchor306" id="FNanchor306"></a><a href="#Footnote306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> And much foreign blood
seems to have been added to the body, between the Exodus
and the Babylonian captivity, through the means of proselytes
and captives, strange women and bondmaids, concubines
and harlots. We read of Rahab, of Jericho, an innkeeper,
or harlot, or both, marrying Salmon, one of the chief
men in the tribe of Judah, and becoming the mother of
Boaz, who married Ruth, a Moabitish woman, the daughter-in-law
of Naomi, and grandmother of David, from whom
Christ was lineally descended. Indeed, the Jews have always
been receiving foreign blood into their body. We
read of Timothy having been a Greek by the father&#8217;s side,
and a Jew by the mother&#8217;s; and of his having been brought
up a Jew. Such events are of frequent occurrence. There
is no real bar to marriages between Jews and Christians,
although circumstances render them difficult. The children
of such marriages sometimes resemble the Jew, and sometimes
the Christian; sometimes they cast their lot with
the Jews, in the matter of religion, and sometimes with the
Christians; but they generally follow the mother in that
matter. Such, however, is the conceit which the Jew displays
in regard to his race, that he is very reserved in
speaking about this &#8220;mixing of the blood.&#8221; I once addressed
a string of questions to a Christian-Jew preacher,
on this subject, but he declined answering them. I am intimate
with a family the parents of which are half-blood
Jews, all of whom belong to the Jewish connexion, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
find that, notwithstanding the mixture of the blood, there is
as little mental difference between them and the other Jews,
as there is between Americans of six descents, by both sides
of the house, and Americans whose descent, through one
parent, goes as far back, while, through the other parent, it
is from abroad. Purity of blood, as applicable to almost
any race, and, among others, to the Jewish, is a figment.
There are many Jews in the United States, and, doubtless,
in other countries, who are not known to other people as
Jews, either by their appearance or their attendance at the
synagogue. As a general principle, no Jew will tell the
world that he belongs to the race; he leaves that to be
found out by other people. Sir J. Gardner Wilkinson says
that the Jews of the East, to this day, often have red hair
and blue eyes, and are quite unlike their brethren in Europe.
He found the large nose at Jerusalem an invariable proof
of mixture with a Western family. It is singular, however,
how easy it is to detect the generality of Jews; the nose,
the eyes, or the features, tell who they are, but not always
so. What may be termed a &#8220;pure Jew,&#8221; is when the person
has no knowledge of any other blood being in his veins
than Jewish blood; or when his feelings are entirely Jewish
as to nationality, although his creed may not be very
strongly Jewish.</p>

<p>I will now consider the relative positions which the Jews
and Gipsies occupy towards the rest of mankind. I readily
admit that, in their original and wild state, the Gipsies have
not been of any use to the world, but, on the contrary, a
great annoyance. Still, that cannot be said altogether; for
the handy turn of the Gipsies in some of the primitive mechanical
arts, and their dealing in various wares, have been,
in a measure, useful to a certain part of the rural population;
and themselves the sources of considerable amusement; but,
taking everything into account, they have been decidedly
annoying to the world generally. In their wild state, they
have never been charged by any one with an outward contempt
for religion, whatever their inward feelings may have
been for it; but, on the contrary, as always having shown
an apparent respect for it. No one has ever complained of
the Gipsy scoffing at religion, or even for not yielding to its
general truths; what has been said of him is, that he is, at
heart, so heedless and volatile in his disposition, that everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
in regard to religion passes in at the one ear, and goes
out at the other. There are, doubtless, Gipsies who will be
&#8220;unco godly,&#8221; when they can make gain by it; but it more
frequently happens that they will assume such an air, in the
presence of a person of respectable appearance, to show him
that they are really not the &#8220;horrible vagabonds&#8221; which,
they never doubt, he holds them to be. They are then sure
to overdo their part. As a general thing, they wish people
to believe that &#8220;they are not savages, but have feelings like
other people,&#8221; as &#8220;Terrible&#8221; expressed it. This much is certain,
that whenever the Gipsy settles, and acquires an incognito,
we hear of little or nothing of the canting in question.
As regards the question of religion, it is very fortunate
for the Gipsy race that they brought no particular one
with them; for, objectionable as they have been held to be,
the feeling towards them would have been worse, if they had
had a system of priestcraft and heathen idolatry among
them. But this circumstance greatly worries a respectable
Gipsy; he would much rather have it said that his ancestors
had some sort of religion, than that they none. It is
generally understood that the Gipsies did not bring any particular
religion with them; still, the ceremony of sacrificing
horses at divorces, and, at one time, at marriages, has a
strange and unaccountable significance.</p>

<p>Then, as regards the general ways of the Gipsies. If we
consider them as those of a people who have emerged, or
are emerging, from a state of barbarism, how trifling, how
venial do they appear! Scotch people have suffered, in
times past, far more at the hands of each other, than ever
they knowingly did at the hands of the Gipsies. What was
the nature of that system of black-mail which was levied by
Highland gentlemen upon Southerners? Was it anything
but robbery? So common, so unavoidable was the payment
of black-mail, that the law had to wink at it, nay, regulate
it. But after all, it was nothing but compounding for that
which would otherwise have been stolen. It gave peace
and security to the farmer, and a revenue to the Highland
gentleman, whom it placed in the position of a nominal protector,
but actually prevented from being a robber, in law or
morals; for, let the payment of the black-mail but have been
refused, and, perhaps the next day, the Southerner would
have been ruined; so that the Highland gentleman would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
have obtained his rights, under any circumstances. For
Highland people, by a process of reasoning peculiar to a
people in a barbarous state, held, as we have seen, that they
had a right to rob the Lowlanders, whenever it was in their
power, and that two hundred years after the Gipsies entered
Scotland.</p>

<p>Scottish Gipsies are British subjects, as much as either
Highland or Lowland Scots; their being of foreign origin
does not alter the case; and they are entitled to have that
justice meted out to them that has been accorded to the ordinary
natives. They are not a heaven-born race, but they
certainly found their way into the country, as if they had
dropped into it out of the clouds. As a race, they have that
much mystery, originality, and antiquity about them, and
that inextinguishable sensation of being a branch of the
same tribe everywhere, that ought to cover a multitude of
failings connected with their past history. Indeed, what we
do know of their earliest history is not nearly so barbarous
as that of our own; for we must contemplate our own ancestors,
at one time, as painted and skin-clad barbarians.
What we do know, for certainty, of the earliest history of
the Scottish Gipsies, is contained, more particularly, in the
Act of 1540; and we would naturally say, that, for a people
in a barbarous state, such is the dignity and majesty, with
all the roguishness, displayed in the conduct of the Gipsies
of that period, one could hardly have a better, certainly not
a more romantic, descent; provided the person whose descent
it is is to be found amid the ranks of Scots, with
talents, a character, and a position equal to those of others
around him. For this reason, it must be said of the race,
that whenever it shakes itself clear of objectionable habits,
and follows any kind of ordinary industry, the cause of every
prejudice against it is gone, or ought to disappear; for then,
as I have already said, the Gipsies became ordinary citizens,
of the Gipsy clan. It then follows, that in passing a fair
judgment upon the Gipsy race, we ought to establish a principle
of progression, and set our minds upon the best specimens
of it, as well as the worst, and not judge of it, solely,
from the poorest, the most ignorant, or the most barbarous
part of it.<a name="FNanchor307" id="FNanchor307"></a><a href="#Footnote307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>What shall we say further of the relative positions which
the Jews and Gipsies occupy towards the rest of the world?
In the first place, the Jews entered Europe a civilized, and
the Gipsies a barbarous, people; so that, in instituting any
comparison between them, we should select Gipsies occupying
positions in life similar to those of the Jews. The settled
Scottish Gipsy, we find, appears to the eye of the world as
a Scotchman, and nothing more. It is the weak position
which the Gipsy race occupies in the world, as it enters upon
a settled life, and engages in steady pursuits, that compels it
to assume an incognito; for it has nothing to appeal to, as
regards the past; no history, except it be acts of legislation
passed against the race. In looking into a Dictionary or a
Cyclop&aelig;dia, the Gipsy finds his race described as vagabonds,
always as vagabonds; and he may be said never to have
heard a good word spoken of it, during the whole of his life.
Hence he and his descendants &#8220;keep as quiet as pussy,&#8221; and
pass from the observation of the world. Besides this, there
is no prominent feature connected with his race, to bring it
before the world, such as there is with the Jewish, viz., history,
church, or literature. A history, the Gipsy, as we see,
doubtless has; but anything connected with him, pertaining
to the church or literature, he holds as a member of ordinary
society. Still, it would not be incorrect to speak of Gipsy
literature, as the work of a Gipsy, acquired from the sources
common to other men; as we would say of the Jews, relative
to the literature which they produce under similar circumstances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
As to the Gipsy to whom I have alluded, it may
be said that it is none of our business whether he is a Gipsy
or not; there is certainly no prejudice against him as an
individual, and there can be none as a Gipsy, except such as
people may of their own accord conceive for him. Many of
the Scottish Gipsies whom I have met with are civil enough,
sensible enough, decent enough, and liberal and honourable
enough in their conduct; decidedly well bred for their positions
in life, and rather foolish and reckless with their
means, than misers; and, generally speaking, what are called
&#8220;good fellows.&#8221; It is no business of mine to ask them, how
long it is since their ancestors left the tent, or, indeed, if
they even know when that occurred; and still less, if they
know when any of them ever did anything that was contrary
to law. Still, one feels a little irksome in such a Gipsy&#8217;s
company, until the Gipsy question has been fairly brought
before the world, and the point settled, that a Gipsy may be
a gentleman, and that no disparagement is necessarily connected
with the name, considered in itself. Such Scottish
Gipsies as I have mentioned are decidedly smart, and, Yankee-like,
more adaptable in turning their hands to various
employments, than the common natives; and are a fair credit
to the country they come from, and absolutely a greater than
many of the native Scotch that are to be met with in the
New World. Let the name of Gipsy be as much respected,
in Scotland, as it is now despised, and the community would
stare to see the civilized Gipsies make their appearance;
they would come buzzing out, like bees, emerging even from
places where a person, not in the secret, never would have
dreamt of.</p>

<p>If we consider, in a fair and philosophical manner, the
origin of these people, we will find many excuses for the
position which their ancestors have occupied. They were a
tribe of men wandering upon the face of the earth, over
which they have spread, as one wave follows and urges on
another. Those that appeared in Europe seem to have been
impelled, in their migration, by the same irresistible impulse;
to say nothing of the circumstances connected with
their coming in contact with the people whose territories
they had invaded. No one generation could be responsible
for the position in which it found itself placed. In the case
of John Faw and his company, we find that, being on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
face of the earth, they had to go somewhere, and invent
some sort of excuse, to secure a toleration; and the world
was bound to yield them a subsistence, of some kind, and in
some way obtained. As a wandering, barbarous, tented
tribe, with habits peculiar to itself, and inseparable from its
very nature, great allowance ought to be made for the time
necessary for its gradual absorption into settled society.
That could only be the result of generations, even if the race
had not been treated so harshly as it has been, or had such
a prejudice displayed against it. The difficulties which a
Gipsy has to encounter in leaving the tent are great, for he
has been born in that state, and been reared in it. To
leave his tent forever, and settle in a town, is a greater
trial to the innate feelings of his nature, than would be the
change from highly polished metropolitan life to a state
of solitude, in a society away from everything that had
hitherto made existence bearable. But the Gipsy will very
readily leave his tent, temporarily, to visit a town, if it is to
make money. It is astonishing how strong the circumstances
are which bind him to his tent; even his pride and
prejudices in being a &#8220;wandering Egyptian,&#8221; will, if it is
possible to live by the tent, bind him to it. Then, there is
the prejudice of the world&mdash;the objection to receive him into
any community, and his children into any school&mdash;that commonly
prevails, and which compels him to <i>steal</i> into settled
life. It has always been so with the Gipsy race. Gipsies
brought up in the tent have the same difficulties to encounter
in leaving it to-day, that others had centuries ago. But,
notwithstanding all that, they are always keeping moving
out of the tent, and becoming settled and civilized.</p>

<p>Tented Gipsies will naturally &#8220;take bits o&#8217; things;&#8221; many
of them would think one simple if he thought they would
not do it; some of them would even be insulted if he said
they did not do it. After they leave the tent, and commence
&#8220;tramping,&#8221; they (I do not say all of them) will still
&#8220;take bits o&#8217; things.&#8221; From this stage of their history, they
keep gradually dropping into unexceptionable habits; and
particularly so if they receive education. But we can very
readily believe that, independent of every circumstance, there
will be Gipsies who, in a great measure, always will be
rogues. The law of necessity exercises a great influence
over the destiny of the Gipsy race; their natural encrease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
is such, that, as they progress and develop, they are always
pushing others out of the sphere which those further advanced
occupy; so that it would not pay for all Gipsies to
be rogues. There is, therefore, no alternative left to the
Gipsy but to earn his bread like other men. If every Gipsy
actually &#8220;helped himself&#8221; to whatever he stood in need of,
it could hardly be said that the ordinary inhabitants would
have anything that they could really call their own. Notwithstanding
the manner how the Gipsies progress, or the
origin from which they spring, it is quite sufficient for me to
hold the race in respect, when I find them personally worthy
of it.</p>

<p>As a Scotchman, as a citizen of the world, whether should
my sympathies lay more with the Gipsies than with the
Jews? With the Gipsies, unquestionably. For, a race,
emerging from a state of barbarism, and struggling upwards
to civilization, surrounded by so many difficulties, as is the
Gipsy, is entitled to a world of charity and encouragement.
Of the Jews, who, though blessed with the most exalted
privileges, yet allowed themselves to be reduced to their
present fallen and degraded estate, it may be said:
&#8220;Ephraim is joined to his idols; let him alone.&#8221; The
Gipsies are, and have always been, a rising people, although
the world may be said to have known little of them hitherto.
The Gipsy, as he emerges from his wild state, makes ample
amends for his original offensiveness, by hiding everything
relative to his being a Gipsy from his neighbours around
him. In approaching one of this class, we should be careful
not to express that prejudice for him as a Gipsy, which we
might have for him as a man; for it is natural enough to
feel a dislike for many people whom we meet with, and
which, if the people were Gipsies, we might insensibly allow
to fall upon them, on account of tribe alone; so difficult is
it to shake one&#8217;s self clear of the prejudice of caste towards
the Gipsy name. The Gipsy has naturally a happy disposition,
which circumstances cannot destroy, however much
they may be calculated to sour it. In their original state,
they are, what Grellmann says of them, &#8220;always merry and
blithe;&#8221; not apt to be surly dogs, unless made such; and
are capable of considerable attachment, when treated civilly
and kindly, without any attempt being made to commiserate
them, and after an acquaintance has been fairly established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
with them. But, what are properly called their affections
must, in the position which they occupy, always remain with
their tribe. As for the other part of the race&mdash;those whose
habits are unexceptionable&mdash;it is for us to convince them
that no prejudice is entertained for them on account of their
being Gipsies; but that it would rather be pleasing and interesting
for us to know something of them as Gipsies, that
is, about their feelings as Gipsies, and hear them talk some
of this language which they have, or are supposed to have.</p>

<p>But how different is the position which the Jews occupy
towards the rest of the world! They are, certainly, quiet
and inoffensive enough as individuals, or as a community;
whence, then, arises the dislike which most people have for
them? The Gipsies may be said to be, in a sense, strangers
amongst us, because they have never been acknowledged by
us; but the Jews are, to a certain extent, strangers under
any circumstances, and, more or less, look to entering Palestine
at some day, it may be this year, or the following. If
a Christian asks: &#8220;Who are the Jews, and what do they
here?&#8221; the reply is very plain: &#8220;They are rebels against
the Majesty of Heaven, and outcasts from His presence.&#8221;
They are certainly entitled to every privilege, social and
political, which other citizens enjoy; they have a perfect
right to follow their own religion; but other people have
an equal right to express their opinion in regard to it and
them.</p>

<p>The Jew is an enigma to the world, unless looked at
through the light of the Old and New Testaments. In
studying the history of the Jews, we will find very little
about them, as a nation, that is interesting, to the extent of
securing our affections, whatever may be said of some of the
members of it. What appears attractive, and, I may say,
of personal importance, to the Christian, in their history, is,
not what they have been or done, but what has been done
for them by God. &#8220;What more could I have done for my
vine than I have done?&#8221; And &#8220;Which of the prophets have
they not persecuted?&#8221; &#8220;Wherefore, behold! I send unto
you prophets, and wise men, and scribes; and some of them
ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge
in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city.&#8221; And
thus it always was. &#8220;Elias saith of them, Lord, they have
killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars, and I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
left alone, and they seek my life.&#8221; Indeed, the whole history
of the Jews has given to infidels such occasion to rail
at revelation, as has caused no little annoyance to Christians.
What concerns the Christian in the Jewish history
is more particularly that which refers to the ways of God,
in preserving to Himself, in every generation, a seed who
did not bow the knee to Baal, till the appearance of Him in
whom all the nations of mankind were to be blessed. Beyond
this, we find that the Jews, as a nation, have been the
most rebellious, stiff-necked, perverse, ungrateful, and factious,
of any recorded in history. How different from what
might have been expected of them! Viewing the history
of the Jews in this aspect, the mind even finds a relief in
turning to profane history; but viewing their writings as
the records of the dispensations of God to mankind, and
they are worthy of universal reverence; although the
most interesting part of them is, perhaps, that which reaches
to the settlement of the race in Palestine. And to sum up,
to complete, and crown the history of this singularly privileged
people, previous to the destruction of their city and
temple, and their dispersion among the nations, we find that
the prophet whom Moses foretold them would be raised up
to them, they wickedly crucified and slew; &#8220;delivering up
and denying him in the presence of Pilate, when he was
determined to let him go. But they denied the Holy One
and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto
them; and killed the Prince of Life, whom God hath raised
from the dead.&#8221; And Pilate &#8220;washed his hands before the
multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just
person: see ye to it. Then answered all the people, and
said, His blood be on us and on our children.&#8221; And his blood
is on their children at the present day; for while he is
acknowledged by three hundred millions of mankind as
their Lord and Master, the Jew teaches his children to
regard him as an impostor, and spit at the very mention of
his name. How great must be the infatuation of the poor
Jew, how dark the mind, how thick the veil that hangs
over his heart, how terrible the curse that rests upon his
head! But the Jew is to be pitied, not distressed; he
should be personally treated, in ordinary life, as his conduct
merits.</p>

<p>The manner in which the Jew treats the claims of Jesus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
Christ disqualifies him for receiving the respect of the
Christian. He knows well that Christianity is no production
of any Gentile, but an emanation from people of his
own nation. And so conceited is the Jew in this respect,
that he will say: &#8220;Jesus Christ and his apostles were Jews:
see what Jews have done!&#8221; He regards the existence
of his race as a miracle, yet looks with indifference upon
the history and results of Christianity. People have often
wondered that Jews, as Jews, have written so little on the
inspiration of the Old Testament; but what else could have
been expected of them? How could they throw themselves
prominently forward, in urging the claims of Moses, who
was &#8220;faithful in all his house as a servant,&#8221; and totally
ignore those of Christ, who was &#8220;a son over his own
house?&#8221; So far from even entertaining the claims of the
latter, the Jew proper has the most bitter hatred for the
very mention of his name; he would almost, if he dared,
tear out part of his Scriptures, in which the Messiah is
alluded to. Does he take the trouble to give the claims of
Christianity the slightest consideration? He will spit at
it, but it is into his handkerchief; so much does he feel tied
up in the position which he occupies in the world. He
cannot say that he respects, or can respect, Christianity,
whatever he may think of its morals; for, as a Jew, he
must, and does, regard it as an imposture, and blindly so
regards it. But all Jews are not of this description; for
there are many of them who believe little in Moses or any
other, or give themselves the least trouble about such matters.</p>

<p>The position which Jews occupy among Christians is
that which they occupy among people of a different faith.
They become obnoxious to people everywhere; for that
which is so foreign in its origin, so exclusive in its habits
and relations, and so conceited and antagonistic in its
creed, will always be so, go where it may. Besides, they
will not even eat what others have slain; and hold other
people as impure. The very conservative nature of their
creed is, to a certain extent, against them; were it aggressive,
like the Christian&#8217;s, with a genius to embrace <i>all</i>
within its fold, it would not stir up, or permanently retain,
the same ill-will toward the people who profess it; for
being of that nature which retires into the corner of selfish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
exclusiveness, people will naturally take a greater objection
to them. Then, the keen, money-making, and accumulating
habits of the Jews, make them appear selfish to those around
them; while the greediness, and utter want of principle,
that characterize some of them, have given a bad reputation
to the whole body, however unjustly it is applied to them
as a race.</p>

<p>The circumstances attending the Jews&#8217; entry into any
country, to-day, are substantially what they were before the
advent of Christ; centuries before which era, they were
scattered, in great numbers, over most part of the world;
having synagogues, and visiting, or looking to, Jerusalem,
as their home, as Catholics, in the matter of religion, have
looked to Rome. In going abroad, Jews would as little
contemplate forsaking their own religion, and worshipping
the gods of the heathen, as do Christians, to-day, in
Oriental countries; for they were as thoroughly persuaded
that their religion was divine, and all others the inventions
of man, as are Christians of theirs. Then, it was a religion
exclusively Jewish, that is, the people following it were,
with rare exceptions, exclusively Jews by nation. The
ill-will which all these circumstances, and the very appearance
of the people themselves, have raised against the Jews,
and the persecutions, of various kinds, which have universally
followed, have widened the separation between them
and other people, which the genius of their religion made so
imperative, and their feelings of nationality&mdash;nay, <i>family</i>&mdash;so
exclusive. Before the dispersion, Palestine was their
home; after the dispersion, the position and circumstances
of those abroad at the time underwent no change; they
would merely contemplate their nation in a new aspect&mdash;that
of exiles, and consider themselves, for the time being,
at home wherever they happened to be. Those that were
scattered abroad, by the destruction of Jerusalem, would,
in their persons, confirm the convictions of the others, and
reconcile them to the idea that the Jewish nation, as such,
was abroad on the face of the earth; and each generation
of the race would entertain the same sentiments. After this,
as before it, it can scarcely be said that the Jews have ever
been tolerated; if not actually persecuted, they have, at
least, always been disliked, or despised. The whole nation
having been scattered abroad, with everything pertaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
to them as a nation, excepting the temple, the high-priesthood,
and the sacrifices, with such an ancient history, and
so unequivocally divine a religion, so distinct from, and obnoxious
to, those of other nations, it is no wonder that they,
the common descendants of Abraham and Sarah, should
have ever since remained a distinct people in the world; as
all the circumstances surrounding them have universally
remained the same till to-day.</p>

<p>A Jew of to-day has a much greater aversion to forsake
the Jewish community than any other man has to renounce
his country; and his associations of nationality are manifested
wherever a Jewish society is to be found, or wherever
he can meet with another Jew. This is the view which he
takes of his race, as something distinct from his religion;
for he contemplates himself as being of that people&mdash;of the
same blood, features, and feelings, all children of Abraham
and Sarah&mdash;that are to be found everywhere; that part of it
to which he has an aversion being only such as apostatize
from his religion, and more particularly such as embrace
the Christian faith. In speaking of Jews, we are too apt
to confine our ideas exclusively to a creed, forgetting that
Jews are a race; and that Christian Jews are Jews as well
as Jewish Jews. Were it possible to bring about a reformation
among the Jews, by which synagogues would embrace
the Christian faith, we would see Jewish Christian
churches; the only difference being, that they would believe
in Him whom their fathers pierced, and lay aside only such
of the ceremonies of Moses as the Gospel had abrogated.
If a movement of that kind were once fairly afoot, by which
was presented to the Jew, his people as a community, however
small it might be, there would be a great chance of
his becoming a Christian, in one sense or other: he could
then assume the position of a protesting Jew, holding the
rest of his countrymen in error; and his own Christian-Jewish
community as representing his race, as it ought to
exist.</p>

<p>At present, the few Christian Jews find no others of their
race with whom to form associations as a community; so
that, to all intents and purposes, they feel as if they were a
sort of outcasts, despised and hated by those of their own
race, and separated from the other inhabitants by a natural
law, over which neither have any control, however much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
they may associate with, and respect, each other. It requires
a very powerful moral influence to constrain a Jew in
embracing the Christian faith&mdash;almost nothing short of
divine grace; and sometimes a very powerful immoral one
in professing it&mdash;that which peculiarly characterizes Jews&mdash;the
love of money. Were a community of Christian Jews
firmly established, among whom were observed every tittle
of the Jewish ceremonial, excepting such as the dispensation
of Christ had positively abolished; or even observing most
of that, (circumcision, for example,) as merely characteristic
of a people, without attaching to it the meaning of a service
recommending themselves, in any way, to the mercy of God;
and many Jews would doubtless join such a society. They
could believe in Christ as their Messiah&mdash;as their prophet,
priest, and king; receive baptism in His name; and depend
on Him for a place of happiness in a future state of existence.
To such, the injunction, as declared by St. Paul, is: &#8220;If
thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt
believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the
dead, thou shalt be saved.&#8221; (Romans x. 9.) And when they
contemplate death, they might lay their heads down in
peace, with the further assurance, as also declared by St.
Paul: &#8220;For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again,
even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with
him.&#8221; (I Thess. iv. 14.) This is the kind of Messiah which
the Jew should contemplate, and seek after. He will find
his conception and birth more particularly recorded in the
two first, and his death, resurrection, and ascension, more
fully detailed in the two last, chapters of the Gospel according
to St. Luke. A person would naturally think that a
Jew would have the natural curiosity to read this wonderful
book called the &#8220;New Testament;&#8221; since, at its very lowest
estimate, it is, with the exception of the writings of St.
Luke, altogether a production of people of his own nation.
Among the Jews, there are not a few who believe in Christ,
yet, more or less, appear at the synagogue. They have no
objections to become &#8220;spectacles to angels;&#8221; but they are
not willing to make themselves such to men, by placing
themselves in that isolated position which a public profession
of Christianity would necessarily lead to. But, all
things considered, one is rather apt to fall into Utopian
ideas in speaking of the conversion of Jews, as a body, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
even as individuals, unless the grace of God, in an especial
degree, accompanies the means to that end.</p>

<p>It is no elevated regard for the laws of Moses, or any
exalted sense of the principles contained in the Old Testament,
that leads a Jew to lend a deaf ear to the claims of
Christianity; for his respect for them has always been indifferent,
even contemptible, enough. Indeed, the Talmud,
which is the Jew&#8217;s gospel, may be characterized as being, in
a very great part, a tissue of that which is silly and puerile,
obscene and blasphemous. It is with the Jew now, as it was
at the advent of Christ. &#8220;They have paid tithe of mint,
and anise, and cummin, and omitted the weightier matters
of the law&mdash;judgment, mercy, and faith.&#8221; &#8220;Laying aside
the commandment of God, they have held the tradition of
men, as the washing of pots and cups, and many other such-like
things;&#8221; &#8220;making the word of God of none effect
through their traditions which they have delivered.&#8221; &#8220;Full
well have they rejected the commandments of God, that they
might keep their own traditions.&#8221; &#8220;In vain do they worship
me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.&#8221;
The main prop of a Jew for remaining a Jew, in regard to
religion, rests much more upon the wonderful phenomena
connected with the history of his nation&mdash;its antiquity, its
associations, its universality, and the length of time which it
has existed, since its dispersion, distinct from the rest of the
world, and so unique, (as he imagines,) that he at once concludes
it must have the special approbation of God for the
position which it occupies; which is very true, although it
proceeds from a different motive than that which the Jew so
vainly imagines. The Jew imagines that God approves of
his conduct, in his stubborn rebellion to the claims of
Christianity, because he finds his race existing so distinct
from the rest of the world; whereas, if he studies his own
Scriptures, he will see that the condition of his race is the
punishment due to its rebellion. Who knows but that the
mark which is to be found upon the Jew answers, in a sense,
the purpose of that which every one found upon Cain? Did
not his ancestors call a solemn imprecation upon his head,
when they compelled Pilate to crucify the &#8220;just person,&#8221;
when he was determined to let him go; with no other excuse
than, &#8220;His blood be on us, and on our children?&#8221; Will
any genuine Jew repudiate the conduct of his ancestors, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
say that Christ was not an impostor, that he was not a
blasphemer, and that, consequently, he did not deserve, by
the law of his nation, to be put to death?</p>

<p>The history of the Jews acts as a spell upon the unfortunate
Jew, and proves the greatest bar to his conversion
to Christianity. He vainly imagines that his race stands
out from among all the races of mankind, by a miracle,
wrought for that purpose, and with the special approbation
of God upon it, for adhering to its religion; and that, therefore,
Christianity is a delusion. But we must break this
spell that enchants the Jew, and &#8220;provoke him to jealousy
by them that are no people.&#8221; And who are this people?
The Gipsies? Yes, the Gipsies! For they are numerous,
though not as numerous, and ancient, though not as ancient, as
the Jews.<a name="FNanchor308" id="FNanchor308"></a><a href="#Footnote308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>As to the Gipsy population, scattered over the world, I
think that the intelligent reader will agree with me, after
all that has been said, in estimating it as very large. There
seems no reason for thinking that the Gipsies suffered so
greatly, by the laws passed against them, as people have
imagined; for the cunning of the Gipsy, and the wild, or
partly uncultivated, face of all the countries of Europe
would afford him many facilities to evade the laws passed
against him. We have already seen what continental
writers have said of the race, relative to the laws passed
against it: &#8220;But, instead of passing the boundaries, they
only slunk into hiding places, and, shortly after, appeared in
as great numbers as before.&#8221; And this seems to have been
invariably the case over the whole of Europe. Mr. Borrow,
as we have already seen, speaks of every Spanish monarch,
on succeeding to the crown, passing laws against the Gipsies.
If former laws were put in force, there would be no occasion
for making so many new ones; the very fact of so many
laws having been passed against the Gipsy race, in Spain, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
sufficient proof of each individual law never having been
put to much execution, but rather, as has already been said,
(<a href="#Page_394">page 394</a>,) of its having been customary for every king of
Spain to issue such against them. It does not appear that
any force was employed to hunt the Gipsies out of the
country, but that matters were left to the ordinary local
authorities, whom the tribe would, in many instances, manage
to render passive, or beyond whose jurisdiction they would
remove for the time being. The laws passed against the
nobility and commonalty of Spain, for protecting the Gipsies,
(<a href="#Page_114">page 114</a>,) is a very instructive commentary on
those for the extermination of the body itself. But the case
most in point is in the Scottish laws passed against the
Gipsies. Upon the passing of the Act of James VI., in
1609, we find that the Gipsies &#8220;dispersed themselves in
certain secret and obscure places of the country&#8221;; and that,
when the storm was blown over, they &#8220;began to take new
breath and courage, and unite themselves in infamous companies
and societies, under commanders&#8221; (<a href="#Page_114">page 114</a>). The
extreme bitterness displayed in Scots acts of parliament
against the best classes of the population, for protecting
and entertaining the tribe, and, consequently, rendering the
other acts nugatory, has a very important bearing upon the
subject. We find that the Gipsies wandered up and down
France for a hundred years, unmolested; and that, so
numerous had they become, that, in 1545, the King of
France entertained the idea of embodying four thousand
of them, to act as pioneers in taking Boulogne, then in possession
of England. The last notice which we have of the
French Gipsies was that made by Grellmann, when he says:
&#8220;In France, before the Revolution, there were but few, for
the obvious reason, that every Gipsy who could be apprehended,
fell a sacrifice to the police.&#8221; Grellmann, however,
had not studied the subject sufficiently deep to account for
the destiny of the race. If they were so very numerous in
France, in 1545, the natural encrease, in whatever position
in life it might be, must have been very great during the
following 235 years. I have learned, from the best of
authority, that there are many Gipsies in Flanders.<a name="FNanchor309" id="FNanchor309"></a><a href="#Footnote309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> If the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
Gipsies in England were estimated at above ten thousand,
during the early part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, how
many may they not be now, including those of every kind of
mixture of blood, character, and position in life? If there
is one Gipsy in the British Isles, there cannot be less than a
quarter of a million, and, possibly, as many as six hundred
thousand; and, instead of there being sixty thousand in
Spain, and constantly <i>decreasing</i>, (<i>disappearing</i> is the right
word,) we may safely estimate them at three hundred thousand.
The reader has already been informed of what becomes
of all the Gipsies. As a case in point, I may ask,
who would have imagined that there was such a thing in
Edinburgh as a factory, filled, not merely with Gipsies, but
with <i>Irish</i> Gipsies? The owner of the establishment was
doubtless a Gipsy; for how did so many Gipsies come to
work in it, or how did he happen to know that his workmen
were <i>all</i> Gipsies, or that even <i>one</i> of them was a Gipsy?</p>

<p>Even to take Grellmann&#8217;s estimate of the Gipsies in Europe,
at from 700,000 to 800,000, and the race must be very
numerous to-day. Since his time, the Negroes in the United
States have encreased from 500,000 to 4,000,000, and this
much is certain, that Gipsies are, to say the least of it, as
prolific as Negroes. The encrease in both includes much
white blood added to the respective bodies. Some of the
Gipsies have, doubtless, been hanged; but, on the other
hand, many of the Negroes have been worked to death.
There is a great difference, however, between the wild, independent
Gipsy race and the Negroes in the New World.
I should not suppose that the Gipsy race in Europe and
America can be less than 4,000,000. It embraces, for certainty,
as in Scotland, men ranging in character and position
from a pillar of the Church down to a common tinker.<a name="FNanchor310" id="FNanchor310"></a><a href="#Footnote310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>Christians not only flatter but delude the Jew, when they
say that his race is &#8220;purity itself;&#8221; they greatly flatter and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
delude him, when they say that the phenomenon of its existence,
since the dispersion, is miraculous. There is nothing
miraculous about it. There is nothing miraculous about the
perpetuation of Quakerdom; yet Quakerdom has existed for
two centuries. Although Quakerdom is but an artificial
thing, that proceeded out from among common English people,
it has somewhat the appearance of being a distinct race,
among those surrounding it. As such, it appears, at first
sight, to inexperienced youth, or people who have never seen,
or perhaps heard, much of Quakers. But how much greater
is the difference between Jews and Christians, than between
Quakers and ordinary Englishmen, and Americans! And
how much greater the certainty that Jews will keep themselves
distinct from Christians, and all others in the world!
It must be self-evident to the most unreflecting person, that
the natural causes which keep Jews separated from other
people, during one generation, continue to keep them distinct
during every other generation. A miracle, indeed! We
must look into the Old and New Testaments for miracles.
A Jew will naturally delude himself about the existence of
his race, since the dispersion, being a miracle; yet not believe
upon a person, if he were even to rise from the dead!
A little consideration of the philosophy of the Jewish question
will teach us that, perhaps, the best way for Providence
to preserve the Jews, as they have existed since their dispersion,
would have been merely to leave them alone&mdash;leave
them to their impenitence and unbelief&mdash;and take that much
care of them that is taken of ravens.</p>

<p>The subject of the Gipsies is a mine which Christians
should work, so as to countermine and explode the conceit
of the Jew in the history of his people; for that, as I have
already said, is the greatest bar to his conversion to Christianity.
Still, it is possible that some people may oppose
the idea that the Gipsies are the &#8220;mixed multitude&#8221; of the
Exodus, from some such motive as that which induces others
not merely to disbelieve, but revile, and even rave at some
of the clear points of revelation.<a name="FNanchor311" id="FNanchor311"></a><a href="#Footnote311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> What objection could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
any one advance against the Gipsies being the people that
left Egypt, in the train of the Jews? Not, certainly, an objection
as to race; for there must have been many captive
people, or tribes, introduced into Egypt, from the many
countries surrounding it. Pharaoh was a czar in his day,
transplanting people at his pleasure. Of one of his cities it
was said,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;That spreads her conquests o&#8217;er a thousand states,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pours her heroes through a hundred gates:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two hundred horsemen, and two hundred cars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From each wide portal, issuing to the wars.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That the &#8220;mixed multitude&#8221; travelled into India, acquired
the language of that part of Asia, and, perhaps, modified its
appearance there, and became the origin of the Gipsy race,
we may very safely assume. This much is certain, that they
are not Sudras, but a very ancient tribe, distinct from every
other in the world. With the exception of the Jews, we
have no certainty of the origin of any people; in every
other case it is conjecture; even the Hungarians know nothing
of their origin; and it is not wonderful that it should
be the same with the Gipsies. Everything harmonizes so
beautifully with the idea that the Gipsies are the &#8220;mixed
multitude&#8221; of the Exodus, that it may be admitted by the
world. Even in the matter of religion, we could imagine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
Egyptian captives losing a knowledge of their religion, as
has happened with the Africans in the New World, and, not
having had another taught them, leaving Egypt under Moses,
without any religion at all.<a name="FNanchor312" id="FNanchor312"></a><a href="#Footnote312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> After entering India, they
would, in all probability, become a wandering people, and,
for a certainty, live aloof from all others.</p>

<p>While the history of the Jews, since the dispersion, greatly
illustrates that of the Gipsies, so does the history of the Gipsies
greatly illustrate that of the Jews. They greatly resemble
each other. Jews shuffle, when they say that the
only difference between an Englishman and an English Jew,
is in the matter of creed; for there is a great difference between
the two, whatever they may have in common, as men
born and reared on the same soil. The very appearance of
the two is palpable proof that they are not of the same race.
The Jew invariably, and unavoidably, holds his &#8220;nation&#8221; to
mean the Jewish people, scattered over the world; and is
reared in the idea that he is, not only in creed, but in blood,
distinct from other men; and that, in blood and creed, he
is not to amalgamate with them, let him live where he may.
Indeed, what England is to an Englishman, this universally
scattered people is to the Jew; what the history of England
is to an Englishman, the Bible is to the Jew; his nation being
nowhere in particular, but everywhere, while its ultimate
destiny he, more or less, believes to be Palestine. Now, an
Englishman has not only been born an Englishman, but his
mind has been cast in a mould that makes him an Englishman;
so that, to persecute him, on the ground of his being
an Englishman, is to persecute him for that which can never
be changed. It is precisely so with the Jew. His creed
does not amount to much, for it is only part of the history
of his race, or the law of his nation, traced to, and emanating
from, one God, and Him the true God, as distinguished
from the gods and lords many of other nations: such is the
nature of the Jewish theocracy. To persecute a Gipsy, for
being a Gipsy, would likewise be to persecute him for that
which he could not help; for to prevent a person being a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
Gipsy, in the most important sense of the word, it would be
necessary to take him, when an infant, and rear him entirely
apart from his own race, so that he should never hear the
&#8220;wonderful story,&#8221; nor have his mind filled with the Gipsy
electric fluid. An English Gipsy went abroad, very young,
as a soldier, and was many years from home, without having
had a Gipsy companion, so that he had almost forgotten
that he was a Gipsy; but, on his returning home, other Gipsies
applied their magnetic battery to him, and gipsyfied
him over again. A town Gipsy will occasionally send a
child to a Gipsy hedge-schoolmaster, for the purpose of being
extra gipsyfied.</p>

<p>The being a Gipsy, or a Jew, or a Gentile, consists in birth
and rearing. The three may be born and brought up under
one general roof, members of their respective nationalities,
yet all good Christians. But the Jew, by becoming a Christian,
necessarily cuts himself off from associations with the
representative part of his nation; for Jews do not tolerate
those who forsake the synagogue, and believe in Christ, as
the Messiah having come; however much they may respect
their children, who, though born into the Christian Church,
and believing in its doctrines, yet maintain the inherent affection
for the associations connected with the race, and
more especially if they also occupy distinguished positions
in life. So intolerant, indeed, are Jews of each other, in
the matter of each choosing his own religion, extending
sometimes to assassination in some countries, and invariably
to the crudest persecutions in families, that they are hardly
justified in asking, and scarcely merit, toleration for themselves,
as a people, from the nations among whom they live.
The present Disraeli doubtless holds himself to be a Jew,
let his creed or Christianity be what it may; if he looks at
himself in his mirror, he cannot deny it. We have an instance
in the Cappadoce family becoming, and remaining for
several generations, Christians, then returning to the synagogue,
and, in another generation, joining the Christian
church. The same vicissitude may attend future generations
of this family. There should be no great obstacle in the
way of it being allowed to pass current in the world, like
any other fact, that a person can be a Jew and, at the same
time, a Christian; as we say that a man can be an Englishman
and a Christian, a McGregor and a Christian, a Gipsy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
and a Christian, or a Jew and a Christian, even should he
not know when his ancestors attended the synagogue.
Christianity was not intended, nor is it capable, to destroy
the nationality of Jews, as individuals, or as a nation, any
more than that of other people. We may even assume that
a person, having a Jew for one parent, and a Christian for
another, and professing the Christian faith, and having the
influences of the Jew exercised over him from his infancy,
cannot fail, with his blood and, it may be, physiognomy, to
have feelings peculiar to the Jews; although he may believe
them as blind, in the matter of religion, as do other Christians.
But separate him, after the death of the Jewish
parent, from all associations with Jews, and he may gradually
lose those peculiarly Jewish feelings that are inseparable
from a Jewish community, however small it may be. There
are, then, no circumstances, out of and independent of himself
and the other members of his family, to constitute him a
Jew; and still less can it be so with his children, when they
marry with ordinary Christians, and never come in intimate
contact with Jews. The Jewish feeling may be ultimately
crossed out in this way; I say ultimately, for it does not
take place in the first descent, (and that is as far as my personal
knowledge goes,) even although the mother is an ordinary
Christian, and the children have been brought up exclusively
to follow her religion.</p>

<p>Gipsydom, however, goes with the individual, and keeps
itself alive in the family, and the private associations of life,
let its creed be what it may; the original cast of mind,
words, and signs, always remaining with itself. In this respect,
the Gipsy differs from every other man. He cannot
but know who he is to start life with, nor can he forget it;
he has those words and signs within himself which, as he
moves about in the world, he finds occasion to use. A Jew
may boast of the peculiar cast of countenance by which his
race is generally characterized, and how his nation is kept
together by a common blood, history, and creed. But the
phenomenon connected with the history of the Gipsy race is
more wonderful than that which is connected with the Jewish;
inasmuch as, let the blood of the Gipsy become as much
mixed as it may, it always preserves its Gipsy identity; although
it may not have the least outward resemblance to an
original Gipsy. You cannot crush or cross out the Gipsy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
race; so thoroughly subtle, so thoroughly adaptable, so
thoroughly capable, is it to evade every weapon that can be
forged against it. The Gipsy soul, in whatever condition it
may be found, or whatever may be the tabernacle which it
may inhabit, is as independent, now, of those laws which
regulate the disappearance of certain races among others,
as when it existed in its wild state, roaming over the heath.
The Gipsy race, in short, absorbs, but cannot be absorbed by,
other races.</p>

<p>In my associations with Gipsies and Jews, I find that both
races rest upon the same basis, viz.: a question of people.
The response of the one, as to who he is, is that he is a Gipsy;
and of the other, that he is a Jew. Each of them has a
peculiarly original soul, that is perfectly different from each
other, and others around them; a soul that passes as naturally
and unavoidably into each succeeding generation of
the respective races, as does the soul of the English or any
other race into each succeeding generation. For each considers
his nation as abroad upon the face of the earth;
which circumstance will preserve its existence amid all the
revolutions to which ordinary nations are subject. As they
now exist within, and independent of, the nations among
whom they live, so will they endure, if these nations were
to disappear under the subjection of other nations, or become
incorporated with them under new names. Many of the
Gipsies and Jews might perish amid such convulsions, but
those that survived would constitute the stock of their respective
nations; while others might migrate from other
countries, and contribute to their numbers. In the case of
the Gipsy nation, as it gets crossed with common blood, the
issue shows the same result as does the shaking of the needle
on the card&mdash;it always turns to the pole: that pole, among
the Gipsies, being a sense of its blood, and a sympathy with
the same people in every part of the world. For this reason,
the Gipsy race, like the Jewish, may, with regard to its
future, be said to be even eternal.</p>

<p>The Gipsy soul is fresh and original, not only from its
recent appearance in Europe, without any traditional knowledge
of its existence anywhere else, but from having sprung
from so singular an origin as a tent; so that the mystery
that attaches to it, from those causes, and the contemplation
of the Gipsy, in his original state, to-day, present to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
Gipsy that fascination for his own history which the Jew
finds in the antiquity of his race, and the exalted privileges
with which it was at one time visited. The civilized Gipsy
looks upon his ancestors, as they appeared in Europe generally,
and Scotland especially, as great men, as heroes who
scorned the company of anything below a gentleman. And
he is not much out of the way; for John Faw, and Towla
Bailyow, and the others mentioned in the act of 1540, were
unquestionably heroes of the first water. He pictures to
himself these men as so many swarthy, slashing heroes,
dressed in scarlet and green, armed with pistols and broad-swords,
mounted on blood-horses, with hawks and hounds in
their train. True to nature, every Gipsy is delighted with
his descent, no matter what other people, in their ignorance
of the subject, may think of it, or what their prejudices may
be in regard to it. One of the principal differences to be
drawn between the history of the Gipsies and that of the
Jews, is, as I have already stated, that the Jews left Palestine
a civilized people, while the Gipsies entered Europe, in
the beginning of the fifteenth century, in a barbarous state.
But the difference is only of a relative nature; for when
the Gipsies emerge from their original condition, they occupy
as good positions in the world as the Jews; while they
have about them none of those outward peculiarities of the
Jews, that make them, in a manner, offensive to other people.
In every sense but that of belonging to the Gipsy tribe,
they are ordinary natives; for the circumstances that have
formed the characters of the ordinary natives have formed
theirs. Besides this, there is a degree of dignity about the
general bearing of such people, rough as it sometimes is,
that plainly shows that they are no common fellows, at least
that they do not hold themselves to be such. For it is to be
remarked, that such people do not directly apply to themselves
the prejudice which exists towards what the world
understands to be Gipsies; however much they may infer
that such would be directed against them, should the world
discover that they belonged to the tribe. In this respect,
they differ from Jews, all of whom apply to themselves the
prejudice of the rest of their species; which exercises so
depressing an influence upon the character of a people. Indeed,
one will naturally look for certain general superior
points of character in a man who has fairly emerged from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
wild and barbarous state, which he will not be so apt to find
in another who has fallen from a higher position in the scale
of nations, which the Jew has unquestionably done. A Jew,
no matter what he thinks of the long-gone-by history of his
race, looks upon it, now, as a fallen people; while the Gipsy
has that subdued but, at heart, consequential, extravagance
of ideas, springing from the wild independence and vanity
of his ancestors, which frequently finds a vent in a lavish
and foolish expenditure, so as not to be behind others in his
liberality. A very good idea of such a cast of character
may be formed from that of the superior class of Gipsies
mentioned by our author, when the descendants of such
have been brought up under more favourable circumstances,
and enjoyed all the advantages of the ordinary natives of
the country.</p>

<p>In considering the phenomenon of the existence of the
Jews since the dispersion, I am not inclined to place it on
any other basis than I would that of the Gipsies; for, with
both, it is substantially a question of people. They are a
people, scattered over the world, like the Gipsies, and have
a history&mdash;the Bible, which contains both their history
and their laws; and these two contain their religion. It
would, perhaps, be more correct to say, that the religion
of the Jews is to be found in the Talmud, and the other
human compositions, for which the race have such a superstitious
reverence; and even these are taken as interpreted
by the Rabbis. A Jew has, properly speaking, little of a
creed. He believes in the existence of God, and in Moses,
his prophet, and observes certain parts of the ceremonial
law, and some holidays, commemorative of events in the
history of his people. He is a Jew, in the first place, as a
simple matter of fact, and, as he grows up, he is made acquainted
with the history of his race, to which he becomes
strongly attached. He then holds himself to be one of the
&#8220;first-born of the Lord,&#8221; one of the &#8220;chosen of the Eternal,&#8221;
one of the &#8220;Lord&#8217;s aristocracy;&#8221; expressions of amazing
import, in his worldly mind, that will lead him to almost
die for his <i>faith</i>; while his <i>religion</i> is of a very low natural
order, &#8220;standing only in meats and drinks, and divers washings,
and carnal ordinances,&#8221; suitable for a people in a state
of pupilage. The Jewish mind, in the matter of religion, is,
in some respects, pre&euml;minently gross and material in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
nature; its idea of a Messiah rising no higher than a conqueror
of its own race, who will bring the whole world
under his sway, and parcel out, among his fellow-Jews, a
lion&#8217;s share of the spoils, consisting of such things as the
inferior part of human nature so much craves for. And his
ideas of how this Messiah is to be connected with the original
tribes, as mentioned in the prophecies, are childish
and superstitious in the extreme. Writers do, therefore,
greatly err, when they say, that it is only a thin partition
that separates Judaism from Christianity. There is almost
as great a difference between the two, as there is between
that which is material, and that which is spiritual. A Jew
is so thoroughly bound, heart and soul, by the spell which
the phenomena of his race exert upon him, that, humanly
speaking, it is impossible to make anything of him in the
matter of Christianity. And herein, in his own way of thinking,
consists his peculiar glory. Such being the case with
Christianity, it is not to be supposed that the Jew would
forsake his own religion, and, of course, his own people, and
believe in any religion having an origin in the spontaneous
and gradual growth of superstition and imposture, modified,
systematized, adorned, or expanded, by ambitious and
superior minds, or almost wholly in the conceptions of
these minds; having, for a foundation, an instinct&mdash;an
intellectual and emotional want&mdash;as common to man, as
instinct is to the brute creation, for the ends which it has
to serve. We cannot separate the questions of race and
belief, when we consider the Jews as a people, however it
might be with individuals among them. It was as unreasonable
to persecute a Jew, for not giving up his feelings
as a Jew, and his religion, for the superstitions and impostures
of Rome, as it was to persecute a Gipsy, for not giving
up his feelings of nationality, and his language, as was specially
attempted by Charles III., of Spain: for such are inherent
in the respective races. The worst that can be said
of any Gipsy, in the matter of religion, is, when we meet
with one who admits that all that he really cares for is,
&#8220;to get a good belly-full, and to feel comfortable o&#8217; nights.&#8221;
Here, we have an original soil to be cultivated; a soil that
can be cultivated, if we only go the right way about doing it.
Out of such a man, there is no other spirit to be cast, but
that of &#8220;the world, the flesh, and the devil,&#8221; before another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
can take up its habitation in his mind. Bigoted as is the
Jew against even entertaining the claims of Christ, as the
Messiah, he is very indifferent to the practice, or even the
knowledge, of his own religion, where he is tolerated and
well-treated, as in the United States of America. Of the
growing-up, or even the grown-up, Jews in that country,
the ultra-Jewish organ, the &#8220;Jewish Messenger,&#8221; of New
York, under date the 19th October, 1860, says that, &#8220;with
the exception of a very few, who are really taught their religion,
the great majority, we regret to state, know no more
of their faith than the veriest heathen:&#8221; and, I might add,
practise less of it; for, as a people, they pay very little
regard to it, in general, or to the Sabbath, in particular,
but are characterized as worldly beyond measure; having
more to answer for than the Gipsy, whose sole care is &#8220;a
good meal, and a comfortable crib at night.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor313" id="FNanchor313"></a><a href="#Footnote313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>Amid all the obloquy and contempt cast upon his race,
amid all the persecutions to which it has been exposed, the
Jew, with his inherent conceit in having Abraham for his
father, falls back upon the history of his nation, with the
utmost contempt for everything else that is human; forgetting
that there is such a thing as the &#8220;first being last.&#8221; He
boasts that his race, and his only, is eternal, and that all
other men get everything from <i>him</i>! He vainly imagines
that the Majesty of Heaven should have made his dispensations
to mankind conditional upon anything so unworthy as
his race has so frequently shown itself to be. If he has been
so favoured by God, what can he point to as the fruits of so
much loving-kindness shown him? What is his nation
now, however numerous it may be, but a ruin, and its members,
but spectres that haunt it? And what has brought it
to its present condition? &#8220;Its sins.&#8221; Doubtless, its sins;
but what particular sins? And how are these sins to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
put away, seeing that the temple, the high-priesthood, and
the sacrifices no longer exist? Or what effort, by such
means as offer, has ever been made to mitigate the wrath
of God, and prevail upon Him to restore the people to their
exalted privileges? Or what could they even propose
doing, to bring about that event? Questions like these involve
the Jewish mind in a labyrinth of difficulties, from
which it cannot extricate itself. The dispersion was not
only foretold, but the cause of it given. The Scriptures
declare that the Messiah was to have appeared before the
destruction of the temple; and the time of his expected advent,
according to Jewish traditions, coincided with that
event. It is eighteen centuries since the destruction of the
temple, before which the Messiah was to have come; and
the Jew still &#8220;hopes against hope,&#8221; and, if it is left to himself,
will do so till the day of judgment, for such a Messiah as
his earthly mind seems to be only capable of contemplating.
Has he never read the New Testament, and reflected on
the sufferings of him who was meek and lowly, or on those
of his disciples, inflicted by his ancestors, for generations,
when he has come complaining of the sufferings to which
his race has been exposed? He is entitled to sympathy,
for all the cruelties with which his race has been visited;
but he could ask it with infinitely greater grace, were he to
offer any for the sufferings of the early Christians and their
divine master, or were he, even, to tolerate any of his race
following him to-day.</p>

<p>What has the Jew got to say to all this? He cannot
now say that his main comfort and support, in his unbelief,
consists in his contemplating what he vainly calls a miracle,
wrapt up in the history of his people, since the dispersion.
That prop and comfort are gone. No, O Jew! the true
miracle, if miracle there is, is your impenitent unbelief.
No one asks you to disbelieve in Moses, but, in addition to
believing in Moses, to believe in him of whom Moses wrote.
Do you really believe in Moses? You, doubtless, believe
after a sort; you believe in Moses, as any other person believes
in the history of his own country and people; but
your belief in Moses goes little further. You glory in the
antiquity of your race, and imagine that every other has
perished. No, O Jew! the &#8220;mixed multitude&#8221; which left
Egypt, under Moses, separated from him, and passed into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
India, has come up, in these latter times, again to vex you.
Even it is entering, it may be, pressing, into the Kingdom
of God, and leaving you out of it. Yes! the people from
the &#8220;hedges and by-ways&#8221; are submitting to the authority
of the true Messiah; while you, in your infatuated blindness,
are denying him.</p>

<p>What may be termed the philosophy of the Gipsies, is
very simple in itself, when we have before us its main points,
its principles, its bearings, its genius; and fully appreciated
the circumstances with which the people are surrounded.
The most remarkable thing about the subject is, that people
never should have dreamt of its nature, but, on the contrary,
believed that &#8220;the Gipsies are gradually disappearing,
and will soon become extinct.&#8221; The Gipsies have always
been disappearing, but where do they go to? Look at
any tent of Gipsies, when the family are all together, and
see how prolific they are. What, then, becomes of this encrease?
The present work answers the question. It is a
subject, however, which I have found some difficulty in getting
people to understand. One cannot see how a person
can be a Gipsy, &#8220;because his father was a respectable man;&#8221;
another, &#8220;because his father was an old soldier;&#8221; and
another cannot see &#8220;how it necessarily follows that a person
is a Gipsy, for the reason that his parents were Gipsies.&#8221;
The idea, as disconnected from the use of a tent, or following
a certain kind of life, may be said to be strange to the
world; and, on that account, is not very easily impressed on
the human mind. It would be singular, however, if a Scotchman,
after all that has been said, should not be able to
understand what is meant by the Scottish Gipsy tribe, or
that it should ever cease to be that tribe as it progresses in
life. In considering the subject, he need not cast about for
much to look at, for he should exercise his mind, rather than
his eyes, when he approaches it. It is, principally, a mental
phenomenon, and should, therefore, be judged of by the
faculties of the mind: for a Gipsy may not differ a whit
from an ordinary native, in external appearance or character,
while, in his mind, he may be as thorough a Gipsy as
one could well imagine.</p>

<p>In contemplating the subject of the Gipsies, we should
have a regard for the facts of the question, and not be led
by what we might, or might not, imagine of it; for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
latter course would be characteristic of people having the
moral and intellectual traits of children. The race might,
to a certain extent, be judged analogously, by what we know
of other races; but that which is pre-eminently necessary,
is to judge of it by facts: for facts, in a matter like this,
take precedence of everything. Even in regard to the
Gipsy language, broken as it is, people are very apt to say
that it <i>cannot</i> exist at the present day; yet the least reflection
will convince us, that the language which the Gipsies
use is the remains of that which they brought with them
into Europe, and not a make-up, to serve their purposes.
The very genius peculiar to them, as an Oriental people,
is a sufficient guarantee of this fact; and the more so from
their having been so thoroughly separated, by the prejudice
of caste, from others around them; which would so naturally
lead them to use, and retain, their peculiar speech. But
the use of the Gipsy language is not the only, not even the
principal, means of maintaining a knowledge of being Gipsies;
perhaps it is altogether unnecessary; for the mere
consciousness of the fact of being Gipsies, transmitted from
generation to generation, and made the basis of marriages,
and the intimate associations of life, is, in itself, perfectly
sufficient. The subject of two distinct races, existing upon
the same soil, is not very familiar to the mind of a British
subject. To acquire a knowledge of such a phenomenon,
he should visit certain parts of Europe, or Asia, or Africa,
or the New World. Since all (I may say all) Gipsies hide
the knowledge of their being Gipsies from the other inhabitants,
as they leave the tent, it cannot be said that any
of them really deny themselves, even should they hide themselves
from those of their own race. The ultimate test of a
person being a Gipsy would be for another to catch the internal
response of his mind to the question put to him as to
the fact; or observe the workings of his heart in his contemplations
of himself. It can hardly be said that any
Gipsy denies, at heart, the fact of his being a Gipsy,
(which, indeed, is a contradiction in terms,) let him disguise
it from others as much as he may. If I could find such
a man, he would be the only one of his race whom I
would feel inclined to despise as such.</p>

<p>From all that has been said, the reader can have no difficulty
in believing, with me, as a question beyond doubt, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
the immortal John Bunyan was a Gipsy of mixed blood.
He was a tinker. And who were the tinkers? Were there
any itinerant tinkers in England, before the Gipsies settled
there? It is doubtful. In all likelihood, articles requiring
to be tinkered were carried to the nearest smithy. The
Gipsies are all tinkers, either literally, figuratively, or representatively.
Ask any English Gipsy, of a certain class,
what he can do, and, after enumerating several occupations,
he will add: &#8220;I can tinker, of course,&#8221; although he may
know little or nothing about it. Tinkering, or travelling-smith
work, is the Gipsy&#8217;s representative business, which he
brought with him into Europe. Even the intelligent and
respectable Scottish Gipsies speak of themselves as belonging
to the &#8220;tinker tribe.&#8221; The Gipsies in England, as in
Scotland, divided the country among themselves, under
representative chiefs, and did not allow any other Gipsies
to enter upon their walks or beats. Considering that the
Gipsies in England were estimated at above ten thousand
during the early part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, we
can readily believe that they were much more numerous
during the time of Bunyan. Was there, therefore, a pot or
a kettle, in the rural parts of England, to be mended, for
which there was not a Gipsy ready to attend to it? If a Gipsy
would not tolerate any of his own race entering upon his
district, was he likely to allow any native? If there were
native tinkers in England before the Gipsies settled there,
how soon would the latter, with their organization, drive
every one from the trade by sheer force! What thing more
like a Gipsy? Among the Scotch, we find, at a comparatively
recent time, that the Gipsies actually murdered a
native, for infringing upon what they considered one of
their prerogatives&mdash;that of gathering rags through the
country.</p>

<p>Lord Macaulay says, with reference to Bunyan: &#8220;The
tinkers then formed a hereditary caste, which was held in
no high estimation. They were generally vagrants and pilferers,
and were often confounded with the Gipsies, whom,
in truth, they nearly resembled.&#8221; I would like to know on
what authority his lordship makes such an assertion; what
he knows about the origin of this &#8220;<i>hereditary</i> tinker caste,&#8221;
and if it still exists; and whether he holds to the purity-of-Gipsy-blood
idea, advanced by the Edinburgh Review and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine, but especially the former. How
would he account for the existence of a hereditary caste of
any kind, in England, and that just one&mdash;the &#8220;tinker caste&#8221;?
There was no calling at that time hereditary in England,
that I know of; and yet Bunyan was born a tinker. In
Scotland, the collier and salter castes were hereditary, for
they were in a state of slavery to the owners of these
works.<a name="FNanchor314" id="FNanchor314"></a><a href="#Footnote314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> But who ever heard of any native occupation, so
free as tinkering, being hereditary in England, in the seventeenth
century? Was not this &#8220;tinker caste,&#8221; at that time,
exactly the same that it is now? If it was then hereditary,
is it not so still? If not, by what means has it ceased to
be hereditary? The tinkers existed in England, at that time,
exactly as they do now. And who are they now but mixed
Gipsies? It is questionable, very questionable indeed, if we
will find, in all England, a tinker who is not a Gipsy. The
class will deny it; the purer and more original kind of Gipsies
will also deny it; still, they are Gipsies. They are all
<i>chabos</i>, <i>calos</i>, or <i>chals</i>; but they will play upon the word Gipsy
in its ideal, purity-of-blood sense, and deny that they are
Gipsies. We will find in Lavengro two such Gipsies&mdash;the
Flaming Tinman, and Jack Slingsby; the first, a half-blood,
(which did not necessarily imply that either parent was
white;) and the other, apparently, a very much mixed Gipsy.
The tinman termed Slingsby a &#8220;mumping villain.&#8221; Now,
&#8220;mumper,&#8221; among the English Gipsies, is an expression for
a Gipsy whose blood is very much mixed. When Mr. Borrow
used the word <i>Petulengro</i>,<a name="FNanchor315" id="FNanchor315"></a><a href="#Footnote315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> Slingsby started, and exclaimed:
&#8220;Young man, you know a thing or two.&#8221; I have
used the same word with English Gipsies, causing the same
surprise; on one occasion, I was told: &#8220;You must be a
Scotch Gipsy yourself.&#8221; &#8220;Well,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I may be as
good a Gipsy as any of you, for anything you may know.&#8221;
&#8220;That may be so,&#8221; was the answer I got. Then Slingsby
was very careful to mention to Lavengro that his <i>wife</i> was
a white, or Christian, woman; a thing not necessarily true
because he asserted it, but it implied that <i>he</i> was different.
These are but instances of, I might say, all the English tinkers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
Almost every old countrywoman about the Scottish
Border knows that the Scottish tinkers are Gipsies.<a name="FNanchor316" id="FNanchor316"></a><a href="#Footnote316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>The prejudice against the name of Gipsy was apparently
as great in Bunyan&#8217;s time as in our own; and there was,
evidently, as great a timidity, on the part of mixed, fair-haired
Gipsies, to own the blood then, as now; and great
danger, for then it was hangable to be a Gipsy, by the law
of Queen Elizabeth, and &#8220;felony without benefit of clergy,&#8221;
for &#8220;any person, being fourteen years, whether natural born
subject or stranger, who had been seen in the fellowship of
such persons, or disguised like them, and remained with them
one month, at once, or at several times.&#8221; When the name
of Gipsy, and every association connected with it, were so
severely proscribed by law, what other name would the
tribe go under but that of tinkers&mdash;their own proper occupation?
Those only would be called Gipsies whose appearance
indicated the pure, or nearly pure, Gipsy. Although
there was no necessity, under any circumstances, for Bunyan
to say that he was a Gipsy, and still less in the face of the
law proscribing, so absolutely, the race, and every one countenancing
it, he evidently wished the fact to be understood,
or, I should rather say, took it for granted, that part of the
public knew of it, when he said: &#8220;For my descent, it was,
as is well known to many, of a low and inconsiderable generation;
my father&#8217;s house being of that rank that is meanest
and most despised of all the families of the land.&#8221; Of whom
does Bunyan speak here, if not of the Gipsies? He says, of
<i>all</i> the families of the land. And he adds: &#8220;After I had
been thus for some considerable time, another thought came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
into my mind, and that was, whether we, (his family and relatives,)
were of the Israelites or no? For, finding in the
Scriptures, that they were once the peculiar people of God,
thought I, if I were one of this race, (how significant is the
expression!) my soul must needs be happy. Now, again, I
found within me a great longing to be resolved about this
question, but could not tell how I should; at last, I
asked my father of it, who told me, No, we, (his father included,)
were not.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor317" id="FNanchor317"></a><a href="#Footnote317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> I have heard the same question put
by Gipsy lads to their parent, (a very much mixed Gipsy,)
and it was answered thus: &#8220;We must have been among the
Jews, for some of our ceremonies are like theirs.&#8221; The best
commentary that can be passed on the above extracts
from Bunyan&#8217;s autobiography, will be found in our author&#8217;s
account of his visit to the old Gipsy chief, whose acquaintance
he made at St. Boswell&#8217;s fair, and to which the reader
is referred, (<a href="#Page_309">pages 309</a>-<a href="#Page_318">318</a>.) When did we ever hear of an
<i>ordinary Englishman</i> taking so much trouble to ascertain
whether he was a <i>Jew</i>, or not? No Englishman, it may be
safely asserted, ever does that, or has ever done it; and no
one in England could have done it, during Bunyan&#8217;s time,
but a Gipsy. Bunyan seems to have been more or less acquainted
with the history of the Jews, and how they were
scattered over the world, though not publicly known to be
in England, from which country they had been for centuries
banished. About the time in question, the re-admission of
the Jews was much canvassed in ecclesiastical as well as
political circles, and ultimately carried, by the exertions of
Manasseh Ben Israel, of Amsterdam. Under these circumstances,
it was very natural for Bunyan to ask himself whether
he belonged to the Jewish race, since he had evidently
never seen a Jew; and that the more especially, as the
Scottish Gipsies have even believed themselves to be Ethiopians.
Such a question is entertained, by the Gipsies, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
at the present day; for they naturally think of the Jews,
and wonder whether, after all, their race may not, at some
time, have been connected with them. How trifling it is for
any one to assert, that Bunyan&mdash;a common native of England&mdash;while
in a state of spiritual excitement, imagined that he
was a Jew, and that he should, at a mature age, have put
anything so absurd in his autobiography, and in so grave a
manner as he did!</p>

<p>Southey, in his life of Bunyan, writes: &#8220;Wherefore this
(tinkering) should have been so mean and despised a calling,
is not, however, apparent, when it was not followed as a
vagabond employment, but, as in this case, exercised by one
who had a settled habitation, and who, mean as his condition
was, was nevertheless able to put his son to school, in an
age when very few of the poor were taught to read and
write.&#8221; The fact is, that Bunyan&#8217;s father had, apparently,
a town beat, which would give him a settled residence, prevent
him using a tent, and lead him to conform with the
ways of the ordinary inhabitants; but, doubtless, he had his
pass from the chief of the Gipsies for the district. The
same may be said of John Bunyan himself.</p>

<p>How little does a late writer in the Dublin University
Magazine know of the feelings of a mixed Gipsy, like
Bunyan, when he says: &#8220;Did he belong to the Gipsies, we
have little doubt that he would have dwelt on it, with a sort
of spiritual exultation; and that of his having been called
out of Egypt would have been to him one of the proofs of
Divine favour. We cannot imagine him suppressing the
fact, or disguising it.&#8221; Where is the point in the reviewer&#8217;s
remarks? His remarks have no point. How could the fact
of a man being a Gipsy be made the grounds of any kind of
spiritual exultation? And how could the fact of the tribe
originating in Egypt be a proof of Divine favour towards
the individual? What occasion had Bunyan to mention he
was a Gipsy? What purpose would it have served? How
would it have advanced his mission as a minister? Considering
the prejudice that has always existed against that
unfortunate word Gipsy, it would have created a sensation
among all parties, if Bunyan had said that he was a Gipsy.
&#8220;What!&#8221; the people would have asked, &#8220;a <i>Gipsy</i> turned
priest? We&#8217;ll have the devil turning priest next!&#8221; Considering
the many enemies which the tinker-bishop had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
contend with, some of whom even sought his life, he would
have given them a pretty occasion of revenging themselves
upon him, had he said he was a Gipsy. They would have
put the law in force, and stretched his neck for him.<a name="FNanchor318" id="FNanchor318"></a><a href="#Footnote318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> The
same writer goes on to say: &#8220;In one passage at least&mdash;and
we think there are more in Bunyan&#8217;s works&mdash;the Gipsies
are spoken of in such a way as would be most unlikely if
Bunyan thought he belonged to that class of vagabonds.&#8221; I
am not aware as to what the reviewer alludes; but, should
Bunyan even have denounced the conduct of the Gipsies, in
the strongest terms imaginable, would that have been otherwise
than what he did with sinners generally? Should a
clergyman denounce the ways and morals of every man of
his parish, does that make him think less of being a native
of the parish himself? Should a man even denounce his
children as vagabonds, does that prevent him being their
father? This writer illustrates what I have said of people
generally&mdash;that they are almost incapable of forming an
opinion on the Gipsy question, unaided by facts, and the
bearings of facts, laid before them; so thoroughly is the
philosophy of race, as it progresses and develops, unknown
to the public mind, and so absolute is the prejudice of caste
against the Gipsy race.<a name="FNanchor319" id="FNanchor319"></a><a href="#Footnote319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>I need hardly say anything further to show that Bunyan
was a Gipsy. The only circumstance that is wanting to
complete the evidence, would be for him to have added to his
account of his descent: &#8220;In other words, I am a Gipsy.&#8221;
But I have given reasons for such verbal admission being, in
a measure, impossible. I do not ask for an argument in
favour of Bunyan not being a Gipsy, but a common Englishman;
for an argument of that kind, beyond such remarks as
I have commented on, is impracticable; but what I ask for is,
an exposition of the animus of the man who does not wish
that he should have been a Gipsy; assuming that a man can
be met with, who will so far forget what is due to the dignity
of human nature, as to commit himself in any such way.
That Bunyan was a Gipsy is beyond a doubt. That he is a
Gipsy, now, in Abraham&#8217;s bosom, the Christian may readily
believe. To the genius of a Gipsy and the grace of God
combined, the world is indebted for the noblest production
that ever proceeded from an uninspired man. Impugn it
whoso list.</p>

<p>Of the Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress, Lord Macaulay, in his happy
manner, writes: &#8220;For magnificence, for pathos, for vehement
exhortation, for subtle disquisition, for every purpose
of the poet, the orator, and the divine, this homely dialect&mdash;the
dialect of plain working men&mdash;was perfectly sufficient.
There is no book in our literature on which we would so
readily stake the fame of the old, unpolluted, English language,&#8221;
as the Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress; &#8220;no book which shows,
so well, how rich that language is in its own proper wealth,
and how little it has been improved by all that it has borrowed.&#8221;
&#8220;Though there were many clever men in England,
during the latter half of the seventeenth century, there were
only two great creative minds. One of these minds produced
the Paradise Lost; the other, the Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress&#8221;&mdash;the
work of an English tinkering Gipsy.</p>

<p>It is very singular that religious writers should strive to
make out that Bunyan was not a Gipsy. If these writers
really have the glory of God at heart, they should rather
attempt to prove that he was a member of this race, which
has been so much despised. For, thereby, the grace of God
would surely be the more magnified. Have they never
heard that Jesus Christ came into the world to preach the
Gospel to the poor, to break the chains of the oppressed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
and raise up the bowed-down? Have they never heard that
the poor publican who, standing afar off, would not so much
as lift up his eyes to heaven, but smote his breast, and exclaimed:
&#8220;God be merciful to me, a sinner,&#8221; went down
justified rather than him who gave thanks for his not being
like other men, or even as that publican? Have they never
heard that God hath chosen the foolish things of the world
to confound the wise; and the weak things of the world to
confound the things which are mighty; and things which
are despised, yea, and things which are not, to bring to
naught things that are: that no flesh should glory in his
presence? I shall wait, with considerable curiosity, to see
whether the next editor, or biographer, of this illustrious
Gipsy will take any notice of the present work; or whether
he will dispose of it somewhat in this strain: &#8220;One of
Bunyan&#8217;s modern reviewers, by a strange mistake, construes
his self-disparaging admissions to mean that he was the offspring
of Gipsies!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott admits that Bunyan was most probably
a &#8220;Gipsy reclaimed;&#8221; and Mr. Offor, that &#8220;his father must
have been a Gipsy.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor320" id="FNanchor320"></a><a href="#Footnote320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> But, with these exceptions, I know
not if any writer upon Bunyan has more than hinted at
the possibility of even a connexion between him and the Gipsies.
It is very easy to account for all this, by the ignorance
of the world in regard to the Gipsy tribe, but, above all, by
the extreme prejudice of caste which is entertained against
it. Does caste exist nowhere but in India? Does an Englishman
feel curious to know what caste can mean? In few
parts of the world does caste reign so supreme, as it does in
Great Britain, towards the Gipsy nation. What is it but
the prejudice of caste that has prevented the world from
acknowledging Bunyan to have been a Gipsy? The evidence
of the fact of his having been a Gipsy is positive enough.
Will any one say that he does not believe that Bunyan
meant to convey to the world a knowledge of the fact of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
his being a Gipsy? Or that he does not believe that the
tinkers are Gipsies? Has any writer on Bunyan ever taken
the trouble to ascertain who the tinkers really are; and
that, in consequence of his investigations, he has come to
the conclusion that they are <i>not</i> Gipsies? If no writer on
the subject of the illustrious dreamer has ever taken that
trouble, to what must we attribute the fact but the prejudice
of caste? It is caste, and nothing but caste. What is it
but the prejudice of caste that has led Lord Macaulay to
invent his story about the tinkers? For what he says of the
tinkers is a pure invention, or, at best, a delusion, on his part.
What is it but the prejudice of caste that has prevented
others from saying, plainly, that Bunyan was a Gipsy? It
would be more manly if they were to leave Bunyan alone,
than receive his works, and damn the man, that is, his blood.
It places them on the level of boors, when they allow themselves
to be swayed by the prejudices that govern boors.
When they speak of, or write about, Bunyan, let them exercise
common honesty, and receive both the man and the
man&#8217;s works: let them not be guilty of petit larceny, or
rather, great robbery, in the matter.</p>

<p>Southey, in his life of Bunyan, writes: &#8220;John Bunyan has
faithfully recorded his own spiritual history. Had he
dreamed of being &#8216;forever known,&#8217; and taking his place
among those who may be called the immortals of the earth,
he would probably have introduced more details of his temporal
circumstances, and the events of his life. But, glorious
dreamer as he was, this never entered into his imagination.<a name="FNanchor321" id="FNanchor321"></a><a href="#Footnote321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>
Less concerning him than might have been expected
has been preserved by those of his own sect; and it is not
likely that anything more should be recovered from oblivion.&#8221;
Remarks like these come with a singular grace from
a man with so many prejudices as Southey. John Bunyan has
told us as much of his history <i>as he dared to do</i>. It was a
subject upon which, in some respects, he doubtless maintained
a great reserve; for it cannot be supposed that a
man occupying so prominent and popular a position, as a
preacher and writer, and of so singular an origin, should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
have had no investigations made into his history, and that
of his family; if not by his friends, at least, by his enemies,
who seemed to have been capable of doing anything to injure
and discredit him. But, very probably, his being a tinker
was, with friends and enemies, a circumstance so altogether
discreditable, as to render any investigation of the kind perfectly
superfluous. In mentioning that much of himself
which he did, Bunyan doubtless imagined that the world
understood, or would have understood, what he meant, and
would, sooner or later, acknowledge the race to which he
belonged. And yet it has remained in this unacknowledged
state for two centuries since his time. How unreasonable
it is to imagine that Bunyan should have said, in as many
words, that he was a Gipsy, when the world generally is so
apt to become fired with indignation, should we <i>now</i> say that
he was one of the race. How applicable are the words of
his wife, to Sir Matthew Hale, to the people of the present
day: &#8220;Because he is a tinker, and a poor man, he is despised,
and cannot have justice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Had Southey exercised that common sense which is the
inheritance of most of Englishmen, and divested himself of
this prejudice of caste, which is likewise their inheritance, he
never could have had any difficulty in forming a proper idea
of Bunyan, and everything concerning him. And the same
may be said of any person at the present day. John Bunyan
was simply a Gipsy of mixed blood, who must have
spoken the Gipsy language in great purity; for, considering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
the extent to which it is spoken in England, to-day, we can
well believe that it was very pure two centuries ago, and
that Bunyan might have written works even in that language.
But such is the childish prejudice against the name
of Gipsy, such the silly incredulity towards the subject, that,
in Great Britain, and, I am sorry to say, with some people
in America, one has nearly as much difficulty in persuading
others to believe in it, as St. Paul had in inducing the
Greeks to believe in the resurrection of the dead. Why
seemeth it unto thee incredible that Bunyan was a Gipsy?
or that Bunyan&#8217;s race should now be found in every town,
in every village, and, perhaps, in every hamlet, in Scotland,
and in every sphere of life?<a name="FNanchor322" id="FNanchor322"></a><a href="#Footnote322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p>To a candid and unprejudiced person, it should afford a
relief, in thinking of the immortal dreamer, that he should
have been a member of this singular race, emerging from a
state of comparative barbarism, and struggling upwards,
amid so many difficulties, rather than he should have been
of the very lowest of our own race; for in that case, there is
an originality and dignity connected with him personally,
that could not well attach to him, in the event of his having
belonged to the dregs of the common natives. Beyond being
a Gipsy, it is impossible to say what his pedigree really
was. His grandfather might have been an ordinary native,
even of fair birth, who, in a thoughtless moment, might
have &#8220;gone off with the Gipsies;&#8221; or his ancestor, on the
native side of the house, might have been one of the &#8220;many
English loiterers&#8221; who joined the Gipsies on their arrival
in England, when they were &#8220;esteemed and held in great
admiration;&#8221; or he might have been a kidnapped infant; or
such a &#8220;foreign tinker&#8221; as is alluded to in the Spanish
Gipsy edicts, and in the Act of Queen Elizabeth, in which
mention is made of &#8220;strangers,&#8221; as distinguished from natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
born subjects, being with the Gipsies. The last is most
probable, as the name, <i>Bunyan</i>, would seem to be of foreign
origin. It is, therefore, very likely, that there was not a
drop of common English blood in Bunyan&#8217;s veins. John
Bunyan belongs to the world at large, and England is only
entitled to the credit of the formation of his character. Be
all that as it may, Bunyan&#8217;s father seems to have been a superior,
and therefore important, man in the tribe, from the
feet, as Southey says, of his having &#8220;put his son to school in
an age when very few of the poor were taught to read and
write.&#8221;</p>

<p>The world never can do justice to Bunyan, unless it takes
him up as a Gipsy; nor can the Christian, unless he considers
him as being a Gipsy, in Abraham&#8217;s bosom. His
biographers have not, even in one instance, done justice to
him; for, while it is altogether out of the question to call
him the &#8220;wicked tinker,&#8221; the &#8220;depraved Bunyan,&#8221; it is unreasonable
to style him a &#8220;blackguard,&#8221; as Southey has done.
He might have been a blackguard in that sense in which a
youth, in a village, is termed a &#8220;young blackguard,&#8221; for
being the ringleader among the boys; or on account of his
wearing a ragged coat, and carrying a hairy wallet on his
shoulder, which, in a conventional sense, constitute any
man, in Great Britain, a blackguard. Bunyan&#8217;s sins were
confined to swearing, cursing, blaspheming, and lying; and
were rather intensely manifested by the impetuosity of his
character, or vividly described by the sincerity of his piety,
and the liveliness of his genius, than deeply rooted in
his nature; for he shook off the habit of swearing, (and,
doubtless, that of lying,) on being severely reproved for
it, by a loose and ungodly woman. Three of the kindred
vices mentioned, (and, we might add the fourth, lying,) more
frequently proceed from the influence of bad example and
habit, than from anything inherently vicious, in a youth
with so many of the good points which characterized Bunyan.
His youth was even marked by a tender conscience, and a
strong moral feeling; for thus he speaks of himself in
&#8220;Grace Abounding:&#8221; &#8220;But this I well remember, that
though I could myself sin, with the greatest delight and
ease, and also take pleasure in the vileness of my companions,
yet, even then, if I had, at any time, seen wicked
things in those who professed goodness, it would make my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
spirit tremble. As, once above all the rest, when I was
in the height of vanity, yet hearing one swear that
was reckoned for a religious man, it had so great a
stroke upon my spirit, that it made my heart ache.&#8221; He
was the subject of these experiences before he was ten
years of age. It is unnecessary to speak of his dancing,
ringing bells, and playing at tip-cat and hockey. Now, let
us see what was Bunyan&#8217;s <i>moral</i> character. He was not a
drunkard; and he says: &#8220;I know not whether there be
such a thing as a woman breathing, under the copes of
heaven, but by their apparel, their children, or by common
fame, except my wife.&#8221; And he continues: &#8220;Had not a
miracle of precious grace prevented, I had laid myself open
even to the stroke of those laws which bring some to disgrace
and open shame, before the face of the world.&#8221; The
meaning of this is, evidently, that he never stole anything;
but that it was &#8220;by a miracle of precious grace&#8221; he was prevented
from doing it. In what sense, then, was Bunyan a
blackguard? There was never such occasion for him to say
of himself, what John Newton said of himself, as a criminal
passed him, on the way to the gallows: &#8220;There goes John
Bunyan, but for the grace of God.&#8221; But such was the
depth of Bunyan&#8217;s piety, that hardly any one thought and
spoke more disparagingly of himself than he did; although
he would defend himself, with indignation, against unjust
charges brought against him; for, however peaceable and
humble he might be, he would turn most manfully upon his
enemies, when they baited or badgered him. &#8220;It began,
therefore, to be rumoured, up and down among the people,
that I was a witch, a Jesuit, a highwayman, and the like. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
also call those fools and knaves that have
thus made it anything of their business to affirm any of
these things aforesaid of me, namely, that I have been
naught with other women, or the like. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My foes
have missed their mark in this their shooting at me. I am
not the man. I wish that they themselves be guiltless. If
all the fornicators and adulterers in England were hanged
up by the neck till they be dead, John Bunyan, <i>the object of
their envy</i>, would be still alive and well.&#8221; The style of his
language even indicated the Gipsy; for English Gipsies, as
Mr. Borrow justly remarks, speak the English language
much better than the natives of the lower classes; for this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
apparent reason, that they have not the dialect of any particular
part of England, which would be, were they always
to have resided in a particular place. It must have been
more so before the middle of the seventeenth century, upwards
of a hundred years after the arrival of the Gipsies in
England; for, in acquiring the English language, they would
keep clear of many of the rude dialects that so commonly
prevail in that country. But Bunyan&#8217;s language was, doubtless,
drawn principally from the Scriptures.</p>

<p>The illustrious pilgrim had many indignities cast upon
him, by the lower and unthinking classes of the population,
and by Quakers and strict Baptists. &#8216;Twas a man like
John Owen who knew how to appreciate and respect him;
for, said he to Charles II.: &#8220;I would readily part with all
my learning, could I but preach like the tinker.&#8221; And
what was it that supported Bunyan, amid all the abuse and
obloquy to which he was exposed, as he obeyed the call
of God, and preached the gospel, in season and out of season,
to every creature around him? When they sneered at his
origin, and the occupation from which he had risen, he
said: &#8220;Such insults I freely bind unto me, as an ornament,
among the rest of my reproaches, till the Lord shall wipe
them off at his coming.&#8221; And again: &#8220;The poor Christian
hath something to answer them that reproach him for his
ignoble pedigree, and shortness of the glory of the wisdom
of this world. I fear God. This is the highest and most
noble; he hath the honour, the life, and glory that is lasting.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor323" id="FNanchor323"></a><a href="#Footnote323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p>In Great Britain, the off-scourings of the earth can say
who they are, and no prejudices are entertained against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
them. Half-caste Hindoos, Malays, Hottentots, and Negroes,
are &#8220;sent home,&#8221; to be educated, and made pets of, and
have the choice of white women given to them for wives;
but the children of a Scottish Christian Gipsy gentleman,
or of a Scottish Christian Gipsy gentlewoman, dare not say
who they are, were it almost to save their lives. Scottish
people will wonder at what caste in India can mean, deplore
its existence, and pray to God to remove it, that &#8220;the
gospel may have free course and be glorified;&#8221; yet scowl&mdash;silently
and sullenly scowl&mdash;at the bare mention of John Bunyan
having been a Gipsy! Scottish religious journals will not
tolerate the idea to appear in their columns! To such people
I would say, Offer up no more prayers to Almighty God, to
remove caste from India, until they themselves have removed
from the land this prejudice of caste, that hangs like an
incubus upon so many of their fellow-subjects at home. It
is quite time enough to carry such petitions to the Deity,
when every Scottish Gipsy can make a return of himself in
the census, or proclaim himself a Gipsy at the cross, or from
the house-top, if need be; or, at least, after steps have been
taken by the public to that end. But some of my countrymen
may say: &#8220;What are we to do, under the circumstances?&#8221;
And I reply: &#8220;Endeavour to be yourselves, and
judge of this subject as it ought to be judged. You can, at
least, try to guard against your children acquiring your
own prejudices.&#8221; To the rising town generation, I would
look with more hope to see a better feeling entertained for
the name of Gipsy. But I look with more confidence to
the English than Scottish people; for this question of &#8220;folk&#8221;
is very apt to rankle and fester in the Scottish mind. I
wish, then, that the British, and more especially the
Scottish, public should consider itself as cited before the
bar of the world, and not only the bar of the world, but
the bar of posterity, to plead on the Gipsy question, that it
may be seen if this is the only instance in which justice is
not to be done to a part of the British population. With
the evidence furnished in the present work, I submit the
name of Bunyan, as a case in point, to test the principle
at issue. Let British people beware how they approach
this subject, for there are great principles involved in it.
The social emancipation of the Gipsies is a question which
British people have to consider for the future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>The day is gone by when it cannot be said who John
Bunyan was. In Cowper&#8217;s time, his <i>name</i> dare not be mentioned,
&#8220;lest it should move a sneer.&#8221; Let us hope that we
are living in happier times. Tinkering was Bunyan&#8217;s <i>occupation</i>;
his <i>race</i> the Gipsy&mdash;a fact that cannot be questioned.
His having been a Gipsy adds, by contrast, a lustre to his
name, and reflects an immortality upon his character; and
he stands out, from among all the men of the latter half of
the seventeenth century, in all his solitary grandeur, a monument
of the grace of God, and a prodigy of genius. Let
us, then, enroll John Bunyan as the first (that is known to
the world) of eminent Gipsies, the prince of allegorists, and
one of the most remarkable of men and Christians. What
others of this race there may be who have distinguished
themselves among mankind, are known to God and, it may
be, some of the Gipsies. The saintly Doctor to whom I have
alluded was one of this singular people; and one beyond
question, for his admission of the fact cannot be denied by
any one. Any life of John Bunyan, or any edition of his
works, that does not contain a record of the fact of his
having been a Gipsy, lacks the most important feature connected
with the man that makes everything relating to him
personally interesting to mankind. It should even contain
a short dissertation on the Gipsies, and have, as a frontispiece,
a Gipsy&#8217;s camp, with all its appurtenances. The
reader may believe that such a thing may be seen, and that,
perhaps, not before long.</p>

<p>It strikes me as something very singular, that Mr. Borrow,
&#8220;whose acquaintance with the Gipsy race, in general, dates
from a very early period of his life;&#8221; who &#8220;has lived more
with Gipsies than Scotchmen;&#8221; and than whom &#8220;no one
ever enjoyed better opportunities for a close scrutiny of their
ways and habits,&#8221; should have told us so little about the
Gipsies. In all his writings on the Gipsies, he alludes to
two mixed Gipsies only&mdash;the Spanish half-pay captain, and
the English flaming tinman&mdash;in a way as if these were the
merest of accidents, and meant nothing. He has told us
nothing of the Gipsies but what was known before, with
the exception, as far as my memory serves me, of the custom
of the Spanish Gipsy, dressing her daughter in such a way
as to protect her virginity; the existence of the tribe, in a
civilized state, in Moscow; and the habit of the members of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
the race possessing two names; all of which are, doubtless,
interesting pieces of information. The Spanish Gipsy marriage
ceremony was described, long before him, by Dr.
Bright; and Twiss, as far back as 1723, bears testimony to
the virtue of Gipsy females, inasmuch as they were not to
be procured in any way. Twiss also bears very positive
testimony on a point to which Mr. Borrow has not alluded,
viz.: the honesty of Spanish Gipsy innkeepers, in one respect,
at least, that, although he frequently left his linen,
spoons, &amp;c., at their mercy, he never lost an article belonging
to him. He alludes, in his travels, to the subject of the
Gipsies incidentally; and his testimony is, therefore, worthy
of every credit, on the points on which he speaks. In Mr.
Borrow&#8217;s writings upon the Gipsies, we find only sketches
of certain individuals of the race, whom he seems to have
fallen in with, and not a proper account of the nation. These
writings have done more injury to the tribe than, perhaps,
anything that ever appeared on the subject. I have met
with Gipsies&mdash;respectable young men&mdash;who complained bitterly
of Mr. Borrow&#8217;s account of their race; and they did
that with good reason; for his attempt at generalization on
the subject of the people, is as great a curiosity as ever I set
my eyes upon. How unsatisfactory are Mr. Borrow&#8217;s opinions
on the Gipsy question, when he speaks of the &#8220;decadence&#8221;
of the race, when it is only passing from its first stage
of existence&mdash;the tent. This he does in his Appendix to the
Romany Rye; and it is nearly all that can be drawn from
his writings on the Gipsies, in regard to their future history.</p>

<p>I do not expect to meet among American people, generally,
with the prejudice against the name of Gipsy that prevails
in Europe; for, in Europe, the prejudice is traditional&mdash;a
question of the nursery&mdash;while, in America, it is derived,
for the most part, from novels. American people will, of
course, form their own opinion upon the tented or any other
kind of Gipsies, as their behaviour warrants; but what
prejudice can they have for the Gipsy race as such? As a
race, it is, physically, as fine a one as ever came out of Asia;
although, at the present day, it is so much mixed with the
white blood, as hardly to be observable in many, and absolutely
not so in others, who follow the ordinary vocations of
other men. What prejudice can Americans have against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
Gipsy blood as such? What prejudice can they have to the
Maryland farmers who have been settled, for at least two generations,
near Annapolis, merely because they are Gipsies and
speak Gipsy? If there is any people in the world who might
be expected to view the subject of the Gipsies dispassionately,
it ought to be the people of America; for surely they have
prejudices enough in regard to race; prejudices, the object
of which is independent of character or condition&mdash;something
that stares them in the face, and cannot be got rid of.
If they have the practical sagacity to perceive the bearings
of the Gipsy question, they should at once take it up, and
treat it in the manner which the age demands. They have
certainly an opportunity of stealing a march upon English
people in this matter.</p>

<p>Part of what I have said in reference to Bunyan, I was desirous
of having inserted in a respectable American religious
journal, but I did not succeed in it. &#8220;It would take up
too much room in the paper, and give rise to more discussion
than they could afford to print.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Perhaps you would
not wish it to be said that John Bunyan was a Gipsy?&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Oh,
not at all,&#8221; replied the editor, colouring up a little. I found
that several of these papers devoted a pretty fair portion
of their space to such articles as funny monkey stories, and
descriptions of rat-trap and cow-tail-holder patents; but for
anything of so very little importance as that which referred
to John Bunyan, they could afford no room whatever. Who
cared to know who John Bunyan was? What purpose could
it serve? Who would be benefited by it? But funny monkey
stories are pleasant reading; every housewife should
know how to keep down her rats; and every farmer should
be taught how to keep his cows&#8217; tails from whisking their
milk in his face, while it is being drawn into the pail. Not
succeeding with the religious papers, I found expression to
my sentiments in one of the &#8220;ungodly weeklies,&#8221; which devote
their columns to rats, monkeys, and cows, and a little
to mankind; and there I found a feeling of sympathy for
Bunyan. Let it not be said, in after times, that the descendants
of the Puritans allowed themselves to be frightened by
a scare-crow, or put to flight by the shake of a rag.</p>

<p>I am afraid that the native-born quarrelsomeness of disposition
about &#8220;folk,&#8221; and things in general, which characterizes
Scottish people, will prove a bar to the Gipsies owning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
themselves up in Scotland. Go into any Scottish village
you like, and ascertain the feelings which the inhabitants
entertain for each other, and you will find that such a one
is a &#8220;poor grocer body;&#8221; that another belongs to a &#8220;shoemaker
pack,&#8221; another to a &#8220;tailor pack,&#8221; another to a &#8220;cadger
pack,&#8221; another to a &#8220;collier pack,&#8221; and another to a &#8220;low
Tinkler pack;&#8221; another to a &#8220;bad nest,&#8221; and another to a
&#8220;very bad nest.&#8221; And it is pretty much the same with the
better classes. Now, how could the Gipsy tribe live amid
such elements, if it did not keep everything connected with
itself hidden from all the other &#8220;packs&#8221; surrounding it?
And is it consonant with reason to say, that a Scotchman
should be rated as standing at the bottom of all the various
&#8220;packs&#8221; and &#8220;nests,&#8221; simply because he has Gipsy blood
in his veins? Yet, I meet with Scotchmen in the New
World, who express such a feeling towards the Gipsies.
This quarrelling about &#8220;folk&#8221; reigns supreme in Scotland;
and, what is worse, it is brought with the people to America.
It is inherent in them to be personal and intolerant,
among themselves, and to talk of, and sneer at, each other,
and &#8220;cast up things.&#8221; In that respect, a community of
Scotch people presents a peculiarity of mental feeling that
is hardly to be found in one of any other people. When
they come together, in social intercourse, there is frequently,
if not generally, a hearty, if not a boisterous, flow of feeling,
and, if the bottle contributes to the entertainment, a foam
upon the surface; but the under-tow and ground-swell are
frequently long in subsiding. Even in America, where they
are reputed to have the clanishness of Jews, we will find
within their respective circles, more heart-burnings, jealousies,
envyings, and quarrellings, (but little or no Irish fighting,
for they are rather given to &#8220;taking care of their
characters,&#8221;) than is to be found among almost any other
people. At the best, there may be said to be an armed
truce always to be found existing among them. Still, all
that is not known to people outside of these circles; for
those within them are animated by a common national
sentiment, which leads them to conceal such feelings from
others, so as to &#8220;uphold the credit of their country,&#8221; wherever
they go. It will be a difficult matter to get the Gipsies
heartily acknowledged among such elements as equals;
for it makes many a native Scot wild, to tell him that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
are Scottish Gipsies as good, if not better, men than he is,
or any kith or kin that belongs to him.</p>

<p>And yet, it is not the Scottish gentleman&mdash;the gentleman
by birth, rearing, education, mind, or manners&mdash;who will be
backward to assist in raising up, and dignifying, the name of
Gipsy. No; it will be the low-minded and ignorant Scots;
people who are always either fawning upon, or sneering at,
those above them, or trampling, or attempting to trample,
upon those below them. It is very apt to be that class
which Lord Jeffrey describes as &#8220;having a double allowance
of selfishness, with a top-dressing of pedantry and conceit,&#8221;
and some of the &#8220;but and ben&#8221; gentry, who will sneer
most at the word Gipsy. It is the flunkey, who lives and
brings up his family upon the cast-off clothes and broken
victuals of others, and out for whom such things would find
their way to the rag-basket and the pigs; &#8216;tis he and his
children who are too often the most difficult to please in the
matter of descent, and the most likely to perpetuate the
prejudice against the Gipsy tribe.</p>

<p>I have taken some trouble to ascertain the feelings of
Scotchmen in America towards the Scottish Gipsies, such as
they are represented in these pages; and I find that, among
the really educated and liberally brought up classes, there
are not to be discovered those prejudices against them, that
are expressed by the lower classes, and especially those from
country places. It is natural for the former kind of people
to take the most liberal view of a question like the present;
for they are, in a measure, satisfied with their position in
life; while, with the lower classes, it is a feeling of restless
discontentment that leads them to strive to get some one
under them. No one would seem to like to be at the bottom
of any society; and nowhere less so than in Scotland. A
good education and up-bringing, and a knowledge of the
world, likewise give a person a more liberal cast of mind,
wherewith to form an opinion upon the subject of the Gipsies;
and it is upon such that I would mainly rely in an
attempt to raise up the name of Gipsy. Among the lower
classes of my own countrymen, I find individuals all that
could be desired in the matter of esteeming the Gipsies, according
to the characters they bear, and the positions they
occupy in life; but they are exceptions to the classes to
which they belong. Here is a specimen of the kind of Scot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
the most difficult to break in to entertaining a proper feeling
upon the subject of the Gipsies:</p>

<p>By birth, he is a child of that dependent class that gets a
due share of the broken victuals and cast-off clothes of other
people. His parents are decent and honest enough people,
but very conceited and self-sufficient. Any person in the
shape of a mechanic, a labourer, or a peasant, appears as
nobody to them; although, in independence, and even circumstances,
they are not to be compared to many a peasant.
The &#8220;oldest bairn&#8221; takes his departure for the New World,
&#8220;with the firm determination to show to the world that he is
a man,&#8221; and &#8220;teach the Yankees something.&#8221; The first
thing he does to &#8220;show the world that he is a man,&#8221; is to
sneer, behave rudely, and attempt to pick quarrels with a
better class of his own countrymen, when he comes in contact
with them. Providence has not been over-indulgent
with him in the matters of perceptors or reflectors; for, what
little he knows, he has acquired in the manner that chickens
pick up their food, when it is placed before them. But he has
been gifted with a wonderful amount of self-conceit, which
nothing can break down in him, however much it may be
abashed for the moment. No one boasts more of his &#8220;family,&#8221;
to those who do not know who his family are, although
his family were brought up in a cage, and so small a cage,
that some of them must have roosted on the spars overhead
at night. No one is more independent, none more patriotic;
no one boasts more of Wallace and Bruce, Burns and Scott,
and all the worthies; to him there is no place in the world
like &#8220;auld Scotland yet;&#8221; no one glories more in &#8220;the noble
qualities of the Scot;&#8221; and none&#8217;s face burns with more importance
in upholding, unchallenged, what he claims to be
his character; yet the individual is a compound of conceit
and selfishness, meanness and sordidness, and is estimated,
wherever he goes, as a &#8220;perfect sweep.&#8221; Although no one
is more given to toasting, &#8220;Brithers a&#8217; the world o&#8217;er,&#8221; and,
&#8220;A man&#8217;s a man for a&#8217; that,&#8221; yet speak of the Gipsies to him,
and he exclaims: &#8220;Thank God! there&#8217;s no a drap o&#8217;
Gipsy blood in me; no one drap o&#8217;t!&#8221; Not only is he unable
to comprehend the subject, but he is unwilling to hear
the word Gipsy mentioned. In short, he turns up his nose
at the subject, and howls like a dog.<a name="FNanchor324" id="FNanchor324"></a><a href="#Footnote324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>It is the better kind of Scottish people, in whatever sphere
of life they are to be found, on whom the greatest reliance
is to be placed in raising up and dignifying the word Gipsy.
This peculiar family of mankind has been fully three centuries
and a half in the country, and it is high time that it
should be acknowledged, in some form or other; high time,
certainly, that we should know something about it. To an
intelligent people it must appear utterly ridiculous that a
prejudice is to be entertained against any Scotchman, without
knowing who that Scotchman is, merely on account of
his blood. Nor will any intelligent Scotchman, after the
appearance of this work, be apt to say that he does not understand
the subject of the Gipsies; or that they cease to
be Gipsies by leaving the tent, or by a change of character
or habits, or by their blood getting mixed. It will not do
for any one to snap at the heels of this question: he must
look at it steadily, and approach it with a clear head, a firm
hand, and a Christian heart, and remove this stigma that has
been allowed to attach to his country. No one in particular
can be blamed for the position which the Gipsies occupy
in the country: let by-gones be by-gones; let us look to the
future for that expression of opinion which the subject calls
for. This much I feel satisfied of, that if the Gipsy subject
is properly handled, it would result in the name becoming as
much an object of respect and attachment in many of the
race, as it is now considered a reproach in others. There
is much that is interesting in the name, and nothing necessarily
low or vulgar associated with it; although there is
much that is wild and barbarous connected with the descent,
which is peculiar to the descent of all original tribes. It is
unnecessary to say, that in a part of the race, we still find
much that is wild, and barbarous, and roguish.</p>

<p>The latter part of the Gipsy nation, whether settled or
itinerant, must be reached indirectly, for reasons which have
already been given; for it does not serve much purpose to
interfere too directly with them, as Gipsies. We should
bring a reflective influence to bear upon them, by holding
up to their observation, some of their own race in respectable
positions in life, and respected by the world, as men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
though not known to be Gipsies. I could propose no better
plan to be adopted, with some of these people, than to give
them a copy of the present work, along with the Pilgrim&#8217;s
Progress, containing a short account of the Gipsies, and a
Gipsy&#8217;s encampment for a frontispiece. The world may
well believe that the Gipsies would read both of them, and
be greatly benefited by the Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress; for, as a
race, they are exceedingly vain about anything connected
with themselves. Said I to some English Gipsies: &#8220;You
are the vainest people in the world; you think a vast deal
of yourselves.&#8221; &#8220;There is good reason for that,&#8221; they replied;
&#8220;if we do not think something of ourselves, there
are no others to do it for us.&#8221; Now since John Bunyan has
become so famous throughout the world, and so honoured by
all sects and parties, what an inimitable instrument Providence
has placed in our hands wherewith to raise up the
name of Gipsy! Through him we can touch the heart of
Christendom! I am well aware that the Church of Scotland
has, or at least had, a mission among the itinerant
Scottish Gipsies. In addition to the means adopted by this
mission, to improve these Gipsies, it would be well to take
such steps as I have suggested, so as to raise up the name of
Gipsy. For, in this way, the Gipsies, of all classes, would
see that they are not outcasts; but that the prejudices which
people entertain for them are applicable to their ways of
life, only, and not to their blood or descent, tribe or language.
Their hearts would then become more easily touched, their
affections more readily secured; and the attempt made to
improve them would have a much better chance of being
successful. A little judgment is necessary in conducting an
intercourse with the wild Gipsy, or, indeed, any kind of
Gipsy; it is very advisable to speak well of &#8220;the blood,&#8221;
and never to confound the race with the conduct of part of
it. There is hardly anything that can give a poor Gipsy
greater pleasure than to tell him something about his people,
and particularly should they be in a respectable position in
life, and be attached to their nation. It serves no great
purpose to appear too serious with such a person, for that
soon tires him. It is much better to keep him a little buoyant
and cheerful, with anecdotes and stories, for that is his
natural character; and to take advantage of occasional opportunities,
to slip in advices that are to be of use to him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
What is called long-facedness is entirely thrown away upon
a Gipsy of this kind.</p>

<p>I am very much inclined to believe that a Gipsy, well up
in the scale of Scottish society, experiences, in one respect,
nearly the same feelings in coming in contact with a wild
Gipsy, that are peculiar to any other person. These are of
a very singular nature. At first, we feel as if we were going
into the lair of a wild animal, or putting our finger into
a snake&#8217;s mouth; such is the result of the prejudice in which
we have been reared from infancy; but these feelings become
greatly modified as we get accustomed to the people.
The world has never had the opportunity of fairly contemplating
any other kind of Gipsy; hence the extreme prejudice
against the name. But when we get accustomed to
meet with other kinds of Gipsies, and have associations
with them, the feeling of prejudice changes to that of decided
interest and attachment. I have met with various
Scottish Gipsies of the female sex, in America, and, among
others, one who could sit any day for an ideal likeness of the
mother of Burns. She takes little of the Gipsy in her appearance.
There is another, taking greatly after the Gipsy,
born in Scotland, and reared in America; a very fine motherly
person, indeed. I cannot, at the present stage of matters,
mention the word Gipsy to her, but I know very well
that she is a Gipsy. It takes some time for the feeling of
prejudice for the word Gipsy to wear off, when contemplating
even a passable kind of Gipsy. That object would be
much more easily attained, were the people to own &#8220;the
blood,&#8221; unreservedly and cheerfully; for the very reserve,
to a great extent, creates, at least keeps alive, the prejudice.
But that cannot well take place till the word &#8220;Gipsy&#8221; bears
the signification of gentleman, in some of the race, as it does
of vagabond, in others.</p>

<p>Some of my readers may still ask: &#8220;What is a Gipsy,
after all that has been said upon the subject? Since it is
not necessarily a question of colour of face, or hair, or eyes,
or of creed, or character, or of any outward thing by which
a human being can be distinguished; what is it that constitutes
a Gipsy?&#8221; And I reply: &#8220;Let them read this work
through, and thoroughly digest all its principles, and they
can <i>feel</i> what a Gipsy is, should they stumble upon one, it
may be, in their own sphere of life, and hear him, or her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
admit the fact, and speak unreservedly of it. They will then
feel their minds rubbing against the Gipsy mind, their spirits
communing with the Gipsy spirit, and experience a peculiar
mental galvanic shock, which they never felt before.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor325" id="FNanchor325"></a><a href="#Footnote325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>
It is impossible to say where the Gipsy soul may not exist
at the present day, for there is this peculiarity about the
tribe, as I have said before, that it always remains Gipsy,
cross it out to the last drop of the original blood; for where
that drop goes, the Gipsy soul accompanies it.<a name="FNanchor326" id="FNanchor326"></a><a href="#Footnote326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>It is the Christian who should be the most ready to take
up and do justice to this subject; for he will find in it a
very singular work of Providence&mdash;the most striking phenomenon
in the history of man. In Europe, the race has existed,
in an unacknowledged state, for a greater length of
time than the Jews dwelt in Egypt. And it is time that it
should be introduced to the family of mankind, in its aspect
of historical development; embracing, as in Scotland, members
ranging from what are popularly understood to be Gipsies,
to those filling the first positions in Christian and social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
society. After perusing the present work, the reader will
naturally pass on to reconsider the subject of the Jews; and
he will perceive that, instead of its being a miracle by which
the Jews have existed since the dispersion, it would have
been a miracle had they been lost among the families of mankind.
It is quite sufficient for the Christian to know that
the Jews now exist, and that they have fulfilled, and will
yet fulfill, the prophecies that have been delivered in regard
to them, without holding that any miracle has been wrought
for that end. A Christian ought to be more considerate in
his estimate of what a miracle is: he ought to know that a
miracle is something that is contrary to natural laws; and
that the existence of the Jews, since the dispersion, is in
exact harmony with every natural law. He should not maintain
that it is a miracle, for nothing having the decent
appearance of an argument can be advanced in support
of any such theory; and far less should he, with his eyes
open, do what the writer on the Christian Evidences, alluded
to, (<a href="#Page_459">page 459</a>,) did, with his shut&mdash;gamble away
both law and gospel.<a name="FNanchor327" id="FNanchor327"></a><a href="#Footnote327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> He might give his attention,
however, to a prophecy of Moses, quoted by St. Paul, in
Rom. x. 19, from Deut. xxxii. 21, wherein it is said of the
Jews: &#8220;I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are
no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you;&#8221; and
lend his assistance towards its fulfillment.<a name="FNanchor328" id="FNanchor328"></a><a href="#Footnote328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> The subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
of the Gipsies is certainly calculated to do all that the
prophet said would happen to the Jews; if Christians will
only do their duty to them, and, by playing them off against
the Jews, <i>provoke</i> and <i>anger</i> Israel beyond measure. That
the Jews have existed, since the dispersion, by the Providence
of God, is what can be said of any other people, and
more especially of the Gipsies for the last four centuries
and a half in Europe. It is as natural for the Gipsies to
exist in their scattered state, as for other nations by the laws
that preserve their identity; and although their history may
be termed remarkable, it is in no sense of the word miraculous,
notwithstanding the superstitious ideas held by many
of the Gipsies on that head, in common with the Jews regarding
their history. A thousand years hence the Gipsies
will be found existing in the world; for, as a people, they
cannot die out; and the very want of a religion peculiar to
themselves is one of the means that will contribute to that
end.<a name="FNanchor329" id="FNanchor329"></a><a href="#Footnote329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> It is the Christian who should endeavour to have
the prejudice against the name of Gipsy removed, so that
every one of the race should freely own his blood to the
other, and make it the basis of a kindly feeling, and a bond
of brotherhood, all around the world.</p>

<p>I may be allowed to say a word or two to the Gipsies,
and more especially the Scottish Gipsies. I wish them to
believe, (what they, indeed, believe already,) that their blood
and descent are good enough; and that Providence may
reasonably be assumed to look upon both with as much complacency
and satisfaction, as He does on any other blood and
descent. All that they have to do is to &#8220;behave themselves;&#8221;
for, after all, it is behaviour that makes the man.
By all means &#8220;stick to the ship,&#8221; but sail her as an honourable
merchantman. They need not be afraid at being discovered
to be Gipsies; they should feel as much assured
on the subject now, as before the publication of this work,
and never entertain the least misgiving on that score. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
will have an occasion to cultivate a proper degree of confidence
in respect to themselves, and be so prepared as never
to commit themselves, if they wish not to be known as Gipsies.
I know there are few people who have nerve enough
so to deport themselves, as to prevent moral detection, who
have committed murder, when they are confronted with the
objects of it; but if the individuals are perfectly satisfied
of there being no evidence against them, they may confidently
assume an appearance of innocence. It is so with
the Gipsies in settled life, as to their being Gipsies. Generally
speaking, their blood is so much mixed as almost to
defy detection; although, for the future, some of them will
be very apt to look at themselves in their mirrors, to see
whether there is much of the &#8220;black deil&#8221; in their faces.
But it rests with themselves to escape detection, and particularly
so as regards the fair, brown, and red Gipsies.</p>

<p>I may also be allowed to say a word or two to the Church,
and people generally. It says little for them, that, although
two centuries have elapsed since Bunyan&#8217;s time, no one has
acknowledged him. It surely might have occurred to them
to ask, <i>1stly</i>: What was that particular family, or tribe, of
which Bunyan said he was a member? <i>2ndly</i>: Who are
the tinkers? <i>3dly</i>: What was the meaning of Bunyan entertaining
so much solicitude, and undergoing so much
trouble, to ascertain whether he, (a <i>common Englishman</i>,
forsooth!) was a Jew, or not? <i>4thly</i>: Was John Bunyan
a Gipsy? Let my reader reply to these questions, like a
man of honour. Aye or nay, was John Bunyan a Gipsy?
&#8220;He <i>was</i> a Gipsy.&#8221;</p>

<p>In modern times people will preach the gospel &#8220;around
about Illyricum,&#8221; compass sea and land, and penetrate
every continent, to bring home Christian trophies; while in
Bunyan they have a trophy&mdash;a real case of &#8220;grace abounding;&#8221;
and yet no one has acknowledged him, although his
fame will be as lasting as the pyramids. John Bunyan was
evidently a man who was raised up by God for some great
purposes. One of these purposes he has served, and will
yet serve; and it becomes us to enquire what further purpose
he is destined to serve. It is showing a poor respect
for Bunyan&#8217;s memory, to deny him his nationality, to rob
him of his birth-right, and attempt to make him out to have
been that which he positively was not. To gratify their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
own prejudices, people would degrade the illustrious dreamer,
from being this great original, into being the off-scourings
of all England. People imagine that they would degrade
Bunyan by saying that he was a Gipsy. They degrade
themselves who do not believe he was a Gipsy; they doubly
degrade themselves who deny it. Jews may well taunt
Christians in the matter of evidences, and that on a simple
matter of fact, affecting no one&#8217;s interests, temporal or eternal,
and as clear as the sun at mid-day; for by Bunyan&#8217;s
own showing he was a Gipsy; but if any further evidence
was wanted, how easily could it not have been collected, any
time during the last two hundred years!</p>

<p>I have hitherto got the &#8220;cold shoulder&#8221; from the organs
of most of the religious denominations on this subject: time
will show whether it is always to be so. The Church should
know what is its mission: it rests on evidence itself, and it
should be the first to follow out its own principles. It
should fight its own battles, and give the enemy no occasion
to speak reproachfully of it. In approaching this subject, it
would be well to do it cheerfully, and gracefully, and manfully,
and not as if the person were dragged to it, with a
rope around his neck. No one need imagine that by keeping
quiet, this matter will blow over. For the Gipsy race
cannot die out; nor is this work likely to die out soon; for
unless it is superseded by some other, it will come up centuries
hence, to judge the present generation on the Gipsy
question. May such as have written on the great dreamer
never lift up their heads, may his works turn to hot coals in
their fingers, may their memories be outlawed, if they allow
this unchristian, this unmanly, this silly, this childish, prejudice
of caste to prevent them from doing justice to their
hero. Nor need any one utter a murmur at the prospect of
seeing the Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress prefaced by a dissertation on
the Gipsies, with a Gipsy&#8217;s camp for a frontispiece. Such a feeling
may be expressed by boors, snobs, and counterfeit religionists;
but better things are to be expected from other people.</p>

<p>Let the reader now pause, and reflect upon the prejudice
of caste that exists against the name of Gipsy, and he will
fully realize how it is that we should know so little about
the Gipsies, and why it is that the Gipsies, as they leave
the tent, should hide their nationality from the rest of the
world, and &#8220;stick to each other.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>In bringing this <a href="#Page_371">Disquisition</a> on the Gipsies to a close, I
may be allowed to say a word or two to some of the critics.
In the first place, I may venture to assert, that the <i>subject</i> is
worthy of a criticism the most disinterested and profound.
I am well aware that the publication of the work places me
in a position antagonistic alike to authors and critics who
have written on the subject, as well as to the prejudices of
mankind generally. If critics call in question any of the
facts contained in the production, they must give their
authorities; if they controvert any of the principles, they
must give their reasons. It will not do to play the ostrich
instead of the critic. For as the ostrich is said to hide its
head in the sand, or in a bush, or, it may be, under its wing,
and imagine that because it sees no one, so no one sees it;
so there are people, sometimes to be met with, who will not
only imagine, but assert, that because they know nothing of
a thing, or because they do not understand it, therefore, the
thing itself does not exist. This was the way in which
Bruce&#8217;s travels in Africa were received. But we are not
living in those times. Procedure such as that described, is
playing the ostrich, not the critic. I refer more particularly,
however, to what is contained in this <a href="#Page_371">Disquisition</a>. Taking
the work all through, I think there are sufficient materials
contained in it, to enable the critics to settle the various
questions among themselves.</p>

<p>To place myself in a position a little independent of publishers,
(for I have had great difficulty in finding a publisher,)
I had the <a href="#Page_55">Introduction</a>, (<a href="#Page_55">pages 55</a>-<a href="#Page_67">67</a>), printed, and circulated
among some acquaintances in Canada, for subscribers.<a name="FNanchor330" id="FNanchor330"></a><a href="#Footnote330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> A
copy of it fell into the hands of an intelligent Scottish
newspaper editor, in a small community, where every one
knows every other&#8217;s business nearly as well as his own, and
where all about the Prospectus was explained to those to
whom it was given. It seems to have frightened and enraged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
the editor to such an extent, that I entertain little
doubt he did not sleep comfortably, for nights in succession,
on finding that subject brought to light at his own door,
which has been considered, by some, as well-nigh dead and
buried long ago. He imagines the circulation of the Prospectus
to be confined pretty much to his own neighbourhood;
and so he must crush the horrible thing out. But what can
he say about it? How put it down? A capital idea occurs
to him; he will father it upon Barnum! Let the reader
glance again at the <a href="#Page_55">Introduction</a>, and imagine how a Scotchman,
well posted up on Scotch affairs, past and present,
should credit Barnum with the production. He heads his
criticism, &#8220;The science of humbug,&#8221; and, in some long and
bitter paragraphs, pitches into what he calls American literary
quackery; the substance of which is, that the work
represented by the Prospectus, is a rare tit-bit of genuine,
Barnumized, American humbug!</p>

<p>He finds, however, that he has gone much too far in his
description of the Prospectus; so he comes tumbling down
a long way from the high position which he took at the start,
and continues: &#8220;Now, we do not, at present, venture the
assertion that the forthcoming &#8216;Scottish Gipsies&#8217; is a Yankee
get-up, a mere American humbug; but we say the Prospectus
savours strongly of the Barnum school; and our reasons
for so saying are the following: <i>Firstly</i>: It would be nothing
less than a literary miracle, that a Scottish work of sufficient
merit to command the highest commendations of Sir
Walter Scott, and Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine, should be published,
first of all in America, thirty years afterwards&mdash;published,
by subscription, at one dollar, in a book of 400 pages.
We assert, positively, that of such a work William Blackwood,
alone, could have disposed of five thousand copies, at
double the proposed price. [He is well acquainted with the
prices of books in the two countries.] <i>Secondly</i>: There is
no evidence to connect Sir Walter Scott&#8217;s note to Quentin
Durward with Walter Simson, or any other particular individual;
and the same may be said of the <i>jingle</i> of Professor
Wilson, and the other allusions in Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine.
<i>Thirdly</i>: There is neither danger nor difficulty in writing
anything you please, and telling the public it is an extract
of a private letter you had from some particular man of
eminence, thirty years ago, provided your eminent friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
has been many years in his grave. Such a fraud is not easily
detected. And <i>Fourthly</i>: The reason assigned for publishing
the &#8216;Scottish Gipsies&#8217; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is totally upset by
the simple fact, that <i>there are no such people in existence, in
so far as Scotland is concerned</i>. [What an audacity he displays
here! What a liberty he takes with the Scotch settlers
in his neighbourhood! He is evidently afraid that he
has gone too far; so he qualifies what he has said, by adding:]
There are, it is true, a few families of itinerant tinkers,
or <i>Tinklers</i>, according to our peculiar vernacular, who
stroll the country, and subsist by making horn-spoons and
sauce-pans, which they barter with the rural peasantry, for
potatoes and other eatables. They are generally wild, reckless,
and dishonest, and are a terror to children and old
women. In nineteen cases out of twenty, they are natives
of Ireland; and were any person idle enough to trace their
genealogy, he would discover that their ancestors, not more
than three generations back, were honest brogue-makers,
pig-drovers, or, it may be, members of some more elevated
occupation. [He has been &#8216;idle enough&#8217; to give us a very
odd account of the descent, in two senses of the word, of
the Irish tinkering Gipsies now in Scotland.] The writer
of these remarks is well acquainted with almost the whole
Lowlands, and a portion of the West Highlands. He has
been familiar with the shires of Fife and Linlithgow, with
Annandale, the Upper Ward of Lanarkshire, and the other
fabulously reputed haunts of the Gipsies [he seems to
have done a little <i>tramping</i> in his time]; and he never saw
twenty Scottish <i>Tinklers</i> in his whole life, nor <i>one single individual</i>
corresponding to the description we have received
of the Gipsies. [He has told us who the <i>Irish Tinklers</i> in
Scotland were originally, but does not venture to say anything
of the <i>Scottish</i> ones. He will not admit that there
is a <i>Gipsy</i> in Scotland, or ever has been; and virtually
denies that there are Gipsies in England; for he continues:]
The nearest approach to the character is the hawkers from
the Staffordshire potteries, who are found living in tents by
the way-side, throughout the North Riding of Yorkshire, and
the five northern counties of England. These are a kind of
savages, who live in families, strolling the country, in large
caravans, consisting frequently of half a dozen canvas-covered
wagons and twice that number of horses. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
These characters often cross the Border, at Langholm and
Gretna Green, and infest Annandale, Roxburghshire, Dumfries-shire,
and the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright. [He will
not allude to the <i>tented Gipsies</i> in England.]</p>

<p>&#8220;These two classes of foreign vagrants [why does he call
them <i>foreign</i> vagrants? why not say <i>Gipsies</i>?] which we
mention, are to be found, occasionally, in certain localities of
Scotland, [still nothing said of the <i>Scottish Tinklers</i>,] and
are to be found as a dreaded, dangerous nuisance. But the
idea of a race of Scottish Tinklers, or Scottish Gipsies, existing
as a distinct and separate people, possessing a native,
independent language, and peculiar habits, rites, and ceremonies,
and bearing, in many features of their barbarous customs,
and outcast destiny, a resemblance to the vagabond
Jews; such an idea, we say, has as little foundation in fact,
as has Swift&#8217;s story of the Lilliputians, or the romance of
Guy Mannering itself! [It is astonishing what he would
not attempt to palm upon the public. Still, he is evidently
afraid that the subject will, somehow or other, bite him; and,
after all that he has said, he concludes:] Still, we do not,
<i>at present</i>, assert that the Prospectus we have received is
another &#8216;cute move of American humbug; but we do say,
if there is a James Simson in existence, who possesses such
a manuscript, and such commendations of it as are set forth
in this Prospectus, he has already erred sufficiently far to ensure
his identification with Yankee quackery. He has been
Barnumized into an egregious blunder.&#8221; [He is bound to
discredit the whole affair, under any circumstances, even at
the expense of the plainest consistency.]</p>

<p>Well might a brother editor reply to the foregoing, thus:
&#8220;The bile of our excellent friend has just been agitated after
a pestilent fashion. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The announcement [of
the intended publication] hath all the ungenial effects upon
our gossip that the exhibition of a pair of scarlet decencies
produces upon a cranky bull. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now, just listen
to us quietly for a little. More than two years ago, the
manuscript of the above-mentioned treatise on the Scoto-Egyptians
came under our ken. We perused the affair with
special appetite, and were decidedly of opinion that its publication
would be a grateful and important boon to the republic
of letters. Mr. Simson is neither a myth nor a disciple
of Barnum.&#8221; Upon the back of this, the first editor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
writes: &#8220;We are pleased to be informed that the work is a
<i>bona fide</i> production, and that Mr. Simson is no Yankee
fiction. [As if he did not know that from the first.] And
albeit he, [the other editor,] furnisheth neither facts nor
arguments to satisfy us that our notions of the Gipsies of
Scotland are heretical, we willingly accept his recommend
that the &#8216;Scottish Gipsies&#8217; will be, at least, an entertaining
book, and reserve all further remarks till we see it.&#8221;[!]</p>

<p>The foregoing is a very curious criticism; and although I
could say a great deal more about it, I refrain from doing so.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote258" id="Footnote258"></a><a href="#FNanchor258"><span class="label">[258]</span></a> This Spanish Gipsy is reported by Mr. Borrow to have said: &#8220;She, however,
remembered her blood, and hated my father, and taught me to hate
him likewise. When a boy, I used to stroll about the plain, that I might
not see my father; and my father would follow me, and beg me to look
upon him, and would ask me what I wanted; and I would reply, &#8216;Father,
the only thing I want is to see you dead!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>This is certainly an extreme instance of the result of the prejudice against
the Gipsy race; and no opinion can be formed upon it, without knowing
some of the circumstances connected with the feelings of the father, or his
relations, toward the mother and the Gipsy race generally. This Gipsy
woman seems to have been well brought up by her protector and husband;
for she <i>taught her child Gipsy from a MS.</i>, and procured a teacher to
instruct him in Latin. There are many reflections to be drawn from the
circumstances connected with this Spanish Gipsy family, but they do not
seem to have occurred to Mr. Borrow.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote259" id="Footnote259"></a><a href="#FNanchor259"><span class="label">[259]</span></a> It is claimed, by some Scottish Gipsies, that there are full-blood Gipsies
at Yetholm, but I do not believe it. This, I may venture to say, that there
can be no certainty, but, on the contrary, great doubt, on the subject. But,
after all, what is a pure Gipsy? Was the race pure when it entered Scotland,
or even Europe? The idea is perfectly arbitrary.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote260" id="Footnote260"></a><a href="#FNanchor260"><span class="label">[260]</span></a> It would be interesting to know where these writers got such ideas about
the purity of the Gipsy blood. It certainly was not from Mr. Borrow&#8217;s
account of the Gipsies in Spain, whatever they may have inferred from
that work.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote261" id="Footnote261"></a><a href="#FNanchor261"><span class="label">[261]</span></a> An instance of this kind of shuffling is given by Mr. Borrow, in the
tenth chapter of the &#8220;Romany Rye,&#8221; in the person of Ursula, a full or
nearly full-blood Gipsy. She confines the crossing of the blood to such instances
as when a Gipsy dies and leaves his children to be provided for by
&#8220;<i>gorgios</i>, trampers, and basket-makers, who live in caravans;&#8221; but she
says, &#8220;I hate to talk of the matter.&#8221; When Mr. Borrow asked her, if a
Gipsy woman, unless compelled by hard necessity, would have anything to
do with a <i>gorgio</i>, she replied, &#8220;We are not over-fond of <i>gorgios</i>, and we
hate basket-makers and folks that live in caravans.&#8221; Here she makes a
very important distinction between <i>gorgios</i>, (native English,) and <i>basket-makers
and folks that live in caravans</i>, (mixed Gipsies.) She does not deny
that a Gipsy woman will intermarry with a native under certain circumstances.
A pretty-pure Gipsy, when angry, will very readily call a mixed
Gipsy a <i>gorgio</i>, or, indeed, by any other name.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote262" id="Footnote262"></a><a href="#FNanchor262"><span class="label">[262]</span></a> Grellmann evidently alludes to Gipsies of mixed blood, when he writes
in the following manner: &#8220;Experience shows that the dark colour of the
Gipsies, which is continued from generation to generation, is more the effect
of education and manner of life than descent. Among those who profess
music in Hungary, or serve in the imperial army, where they have learned
to pay more attention to order and cleanliness, there are many to be found
whose extraction is not at all discernible in their colour.&#8221; For my part, I
cannot say that such language is applicable to full-blood Gipsies. Still, the
change from tented to settled and tidy Gipsydom is apt to show its effects
in modifying the complexion of such Gipsies, and to a much greater degree
in their descendants.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote263" id="Footnote263"></a><a href="#FNanchor263"><span class="label">[263]</span></a> Mr. Offor, editor of a late edition of Bunyan&#8217;s works, writes, in &#8220;Notes
and Queries,&#8221; thus: &#8220;I have avoided much intercourse with this class, fearing
the fate of Mr. Hoyland, who, being a Quaker, was shot by one of
Cupid&#8217;s darts from a black-eyed Gipsy girl; and <i>J. S. may do well to be cautious</i>.&#8221;
Mr. Offor is not far wrong. A Gipsy girl can sometimes fascinate
a &#8220;white fellow,&#8221; as a snake can a bird&mdash;make him flutter, and particularly
so, should the &#8220;little Gipsy&#8221; be met with in some such dress as black silks
and a white polka. This much can be said of Gipsy women, which cannot
be said of all women, that they know their places, and are not apt to <i>usurp</i>
the rights of the <i>rajahs</i>; they will even &#8220;work the nails off their fingers&#8221;
to make them feel comfortable.</p>

<p>I should conclude, from what Mr. Offor says, that the Quaker married
the Gipsy girl. If children were born of the union, they will be Gipsy-Quakers,
or Quaker-Gipsies, whichever expression we choose to adopt.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote264" id="Footnote264"></a><a href="#FNanchor264"><span class="label">[264]</span></a> I have picked up quite a number of Scottish Gipsies of respectable
character, from their having gone in their youth, to look at the &#8220;old thing.&#8221;
It is the most natural thing in the world for them to do. What is it to
look back to the time of James V., in 1540, when John Faw was lord-paramount
over the Gipsies in Scotland? Imagine, then, the natural curiosity
of a young Gipsy, brought up in a town, to look at something like the original
condition of his ancestors. Such a Gipsy will leave Edinburgh, for
example, and travel over the south of Scotland, &#8220;casting his sign,&#8221; as he
passes through the villages, in every one of which he will find Gipsies.
Some of these villages are almost entirely occupied by Gipsies. James
Hogg is reported, in Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine, to say, that Lochmaben is
&#8220;stocked&#8221; with them.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote265" id="Footnote265"></a><a href="#FNanchor265"><span class="label">[265]</span></a> Among the English Gipsies, fair-haired ones are looked upon by the
purer sort, or even by those taking after the Gipsy, as &#8220;small potatoes.&#8221;
The consequence is they have to make up for their want of blood, by smartness,
knowledge of the language, or something that will go to balance the
deficiency of blood. They generally lay claim to the <i>intellect</i>, while they
yield the <i>blood</i> to the others. A full or nearly full-blood young English Gipsy
looks upon herself with all the pride of a little duchess, while in the company
of young male mixed Gipsies. A mixed Gipsy may reasonably be
assumed to be more intelligent than one of the old stock, were it only for
this reason, that the mixture softens down the natural conceit and bigotry
of the Gipsy; while, as regards his personal appearance, it puts him in a
more improvable position. Still, a full-blood Gipsy looks up to a mixed
Gipsy, if he is anything of a superior man, and freely acknowledges the
blood. Indeed, the two kinds will readily marry, if circumstances bring
them together. To a couple of such Gipsies I said: &#8220;What difference does
it make, if the person <i>has the blood, and has his heart in the right place</i>?&#8221;
&#8220;That&#8217;s the idea; that&#8217;s exactly the idea,&#8221; they both replied.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote266" id="Footnote266"></a><a href="#FNanchor266"><span class="label">[266]</span></a> To thoroughly understand how a Gipsy, with fair hair and blue eyes,
can be as much a Gipsy as one with black, may be termed &#8220;passing the
<i>pons assinorum</i> of the Gipsy question.&#8221; Once over the bridge, and there
are no difficulties to be encountered on the journey, unless it be to understand
that a Gipsy can be a Gipsy without living in a tent or being a rogue.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote267" id="Footnote267"></a><a href="#FNanchor267"><span class="label">[267]</span></a> There is a considerable resemblance between Gipsyism, in its harmless
aspect, and Freemasonry; with this difference, that the former is a general,
while the latter is a special, society; that is to say, the Gipsies have the
language, or some of the words, and the signs, peculiar to the whole race,
which each individual or class will use for different purposes. The race
does not necessarily, and does not in fact, have intercourse with every
other member of it; in that respect, they resemble any ordinary community
of men. Masonry, as my reader may be aware, is a society of what
may be termed &#8220;a mixed multitude of good fellows, who are all pledged to
befriend and help each other.&#8221; The radical elements of Masonry may be
termed a &#8220;rope of sand,&#8221; which the vows of the Order work into the most
closely and strongly formed coil of any to be found in the world. But it
is altogether of an artificial nature; while Gipsyism is natural&mdash;something
that, when separated from objectionable habits, one might almost call divine;
for it is founded upon a question of race&mdash;a question of blood. The cement
of a creed is weak, in comparison with that which binds the Gipsies together;
for a people, like an individual, may have one creed to-day, and another
to-morrow; it may be continually travelling round the circle of every form
of faith; but blood, under certain circumstances, is absolute and immutable.</p>

<p>There are many Gipsies Freemasons; indeed, they are the very people
to push their way into a Mason&#8217;s lodge; for they have secrets of their own,
and are naturally anxious to pry into those of others, by which they may
be benefited. I was told of a Gipsy who died lately, the Master of a Masons&#8217;
Lodge. A friend, a Mason, told me, the other day, of his having entered a
house in Yetholm, where were five Gipsies, all of whom responded to his
Masonic signs. Masons should therefore interest themselves in, and befriend,
the Gipsies.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote268" id="Footnote268"></a><a href="#FNanchor268"><span class="label">[268]</span></a> The principle, or rather fact, here involved, simple as it is in itself, is
evidently very difficult of comprehension by the native Scottish mind.
Any person understands perfectly well how a Highlander, at the present
day, is still a Highlander, notwithstanding the great change that has come
over the character of his race. But our Scottish <i>literati</i> seem to have been
altogether at sea, in comprehending the same principle as applicable to the
Gipsies. They might naturally have asked themselves, whether <i>Gipsies</i>
could have procreated <i>Jews</i>; and, if not Jews, how they could have procreated
<i>gorgios</i>, (as English Gipsies term natives.) A writer in Blackwood&#8217;s
Magazine says, in reference to Billy Marshall, a Gipsy chief, to whom
allusion has already been made: &#8220;Who were his descendants I cannot
tell; I am sure he could not do it himself, if he were living. It is known
that they were prodigiously numerous; I dare say numberless.&#8221; And yet
this writer gravely says that &#8220;the <i>race</i> is in some risk of becoming extinct(!)&#8221;
Another writer in Blackwood says: &#8220;Their numbers may perhaps
have since been diminished, in particular States, by <i>the progress of
civilization(!)</i>&#8221; We would naturally pronounce any person crazy who
would maintain that there were no Highlanders in Scotland, owing to their
having &#8220;changed their habits.&#8221; We could, with as much reason, say the
same of those who will maintain this opinion in regard to the Gipsies.
There has been a great deal of what is called genius expended upon the
Gipsies, but wonderfully little common sense.</p>

<p>As the Jews, during their pilgrimage in the Wilderness, were protected
from their enemies by a cloud, so have the Gipsies, in their encrease and
development, been shielded from theirs, by a mist of ignorance, which, it
would seem, requires no little trouble to dispel.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote269" id="Footnote269"></a><a href="#FNanchor269"><span class="label">[269]</span></a> In Olmstead&#8217;s &#8220;Journey in the Seaboard Slave States&#8221; it is stated, that
in Alexandria, Louisiana, when under the Spanish rule, there were &#8220;French
and Spanish, <i>Egyptians</i> and Indians, Mulattoes and Negroes.&#8221; This author
reports a conversation which he had with a planter, by which it appears
that these Egyptians came from &#8220;some of the Northern Islands;&#8221; that they
spoke a language among themselves, but could talk French and Spanish
too; that they were black, but not very black, and as good citizens as any,
and passed for white folk. The planter believed they married mostly with
mulattoes, and that a good many of the mulattoes had Egyptian blood in
them too. He believed these Egyptians had disappeared since the State
became part of the Union. Mr. Olmstead remarks: &#8220;The Egyptians were
probably Spanish Gipsies, though I have never heard of any of them being
in America in any other way.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote270" id="Footnote270"></a><a href="#FNanchor270"><span class="label">[270]</span></a> Mr. Borrow surely cannot mean that a Gipsy ceases to be a Gipsy,
when he settles down, and &#8220;turns over a new leaf;&#8221; and that this &#8220;change
of habits&#8221; changes his descent, blood, appearance, language and nationality!
What, then, does he mean, when he says that the Spanish Gipsies have decreased
by &#8220;a partial change of habits?&#8221;</p>

<p>And does an infusion of Spanish blood, implied in a &#8220;freer intercourse
with the Spanish population,&#8221; lead to the Gipsy element being wiped out;
or does it lead to the Spanish feeling being lost in Gipsydom? Which is
the element to be operated upon&mdash;the Spanish or the Gipsy? Which is the
<i>leaven</i>? The Spanish element is the <i>passive</i>, the Gipsy the <i>active</i>. As a
question of philosophy, the most simple of comprehension, and, above all,
as a matter of fact, the foreign element introduced, <i>in detail</i>, into the <i>body</i>
of Gipsydom, goes with that body, and, in feeling, becomes incorporated
with it, although, in physical appearance, it changes the Gipsy race, so
that it becomes &#8220;confounded with the residue of the population,&#8221; but remains
Gipsy, as before. A Spanish Gipsy is a Spaniard as he stands, and
it would be hard to say what we should ask him to do, to become more a
Spaniard than he is already.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote271" id="Footnote271"></a><a href="#FNanchor271"><span class="label">[271]</span></a> Mr. Borrow mentions, in the twenty-second chapter of the &#8220;Bible in
Spain,&#8221; having met several cavalry soldiers from Granada, Gipsies <i>incog.</i>
who were surprised at being discovered to be Gipsies. They had been impressed,
but carried on a trade in horses, in league with the captain of their
company. They said: &#8220;We have been to the wars, but not to fight; we left
that to the Busn&eacute;. We have kept together, and like true Calor&eacute;, have stood
back to back. We have made money in the wars.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote272" id="Footnote272"></a><a href="#FNanchor272"><span class="label">[272]</span></a> It would seem that the law in Spain, in regard to the Gipsies, stands
pretty much where it did&mdash;that is, the people are, in a sense, tolerated, but
that the use of their language is prohibited, as may be gathered from an
incident mentioned in the ninth chapter of the &#8220;Bible in Spain,&#8221; by Mr.
Borrow.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote273" id="Footnote273"></a><a href="#FNanchor273"><span class="label">[273]</span></a> Paget says these tinkers leave their women and children at home when

was much allayed all the town over.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Bunyan.</i></p>

<p><a name="Footnote275" id="Footnote275"></a><a href="#FNanchor275"><span class="label">[275]</span></a> &#8220;Grand was the repose of his lofty brow, dark eye, and aspect of soft
and melancholy meaning. It was a face from which every evil and earthly
passion seemed purged. A deep gravity lay upon his countenance, which
had the solemnity, without the sternness, of one of our old reformers. You
could almost fancy a halo completing its apostolic character.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote276" id="Footnote276"></a><a href="#FNanchor276"><span class="label">[276]</span></a> Burns alludes to this family, thus: &#8220;Passed through the most glorious
corn country I ever saw, till I reached Dunbar, a neat little town. Dine
with Provost Fall, an eminent merchant, and most respectable character,
but indescribable, as he exhibits no marked traits. Mrs. Fall, a genius in
painting; fully more clever in the fine arts and sciences than my friend
Lady Wauchope, without her consummate assurance of her own abilities.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Life
of Burns, by Robert Chambers.</i></p>

<p>The crest of the Falls, of Dunbar, was <i>three</i> boars&#8217; heads, couped; that of
Baillie, of Lamington, is <i>one</i> boar&#8217;s head, couped. In the Statistical Account
of Scotland, (1835,) appears the following notice of this family: &#8220;A family,
of the name of Fall, established themselves at Dunbar, and became, during
the last century, the most extensive merchants in Scotland. They were
long the chief magistrates of the burgh, and preferred the public good to
their own profit. They have left no one to bear their name, <i>not even a
stone to tell where they lie</i>; but they will long be remembered for their enterprise
and public spirit.&#8221; There is apparently a reason for &#8220;not even a
stone being left to tell where they lie;&#8221; for in Hoyland&#8217;s &#8220;Survey of the
Gipsies&#8221; appeared the account of Baillie Smith, in which it is said: &#8220;The
descendants of Faa now take the name of Fall, from the Messrs. Fall, of
Dunbar, who, they pride themselves in saying, <i>are of the same stock and
lineage</i>;&#8221; which seems to have frightened their connexions at being known
to be Gipsies.</p>

<p>Let all that has been said of the Falls be considered as their monument
and epitaph; so that their memories may be preserved as long as this
work exists.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to know who the Captain Fall was, who visited
Dunbar, with an American ship-of-war, during the time of Paul Jones. He
might have been a descendant of a Gipsy, sent to the plantations, in the
olden times. There are, as I have said before, a great many scions of Gipsy
Faas, under one name or other, scattered over the world.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote278" id="Footnote278"></a><a href="#FNanchor278"><span class="label">[278]</span></a> Of the Gipsies at Moscow, the following is the substance of what Mr.
Borrow says: &#8220;Those who have been accustomed to consider the Gipsy as
a wandering outcast .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. will be surprised to learn that,
amongst the Gipsies of Moscow, there are not a few who inhabit stately
houses, go abroad in elegant equipages, and are behind the higher order of
Russians neither in appearance nor mental acquirements. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
sums obtained by the Gipsy females, by the exercise of their art (singing
in the choirs of Moscow,) enable them to support their relatives in affluence
and luxury. Some are married to Russians; and no one who has
visited Russia can but be aware that a lovely and accomplished countess,
of the noble and numerous family of Tolstoy is, by birth, a Zigana, and was
originally one of the principal attractions of a Romany choir at Moscow.&#8221;</p>

<p>This short notice appears unsatisfactory, considering, as Mr. Borrow
says, that one of his principal motives for visiting Moscow was to hold
communication with the Gipsies. It might have occurred to him to enquire
what relation the children of such marriages would bear to Gipsydom
generally; that is, would they be initiated in the mysteries, and taught the
language, and hold themselves to be Gipsies? It is evident, however, that
the Gipsy-drilling process is going on among the Russian nobility.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote279" id="Footnote279"></a><a href="#FNanchor279"><span class="label">[279]</span></a> On his return with his gallant prey, he passed a very large hay-stack.
It occurred to the provident laird that this would be extremely convenient
to fodder his new stock of cattle; but, as no means of transporting it were
obvious, he was fain to take leave of it, with the apostrophe, now become
proverbial, &#8220;<i>By my saul, had ye but four feet, ye should not stand lang there.</i>&#8221;
In short, as Froissart says of a similar class of feudal robbers. &#8220;Nothing
came amiss to them that was not <i>too heavy</i> or <i>too hot</i>.&#8221; Sir Walter Scott
speaks, in the most jocular manner, of an ancestress who had a <i>curious
hand at pickling the beef which her husband stole</i>; and that there was not a
stain upon his escutcheon, barring Border theft and high treason.&mdash;<i>Lockhart&#8217;s
Life of Sir Walter Scott.</i></p>

<p><a name="Footnote282" id="Footnote282"></a><a href="#FNanchor282"><span class="label">[282]</span></a> In expatiating on the subject of the Gipsy race always being the Gipsy
race, I have had it remarked to me: &#8220;Suppose Gipsies should not mention
to their children the fact of their being Gipsies.&#8221; In that case, I replied,
the children, especially if, for the most part, of white blood, would simply
not be Gipsies; they would, of course, have some of &#8220;the blood,&#8221; but they
would not be Gipsies if they had no knowledge of the fact. But to suppose
that Gipsies should not learn that they are Gipsies, on account of
their parents not telling them of it, is to presume that they had no other
relatives. Their being Gipsies is constantly talked of among themselves;
so that, if Gipsy children should not hear their &#8220;wonderful story&#8221; from
their parents, they would readily enough hear it from their other relatives.
This is assuming, however, that the Gipsy mind can act otherwise than the
Gipsy mind; which it cannot.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens, as the Gipsies separate into classes, like all other
races or communities of men, that a great deal of jealousy is stirred up in
the minds of the poorer members of the tribe, on account of their being
shunned by the wealthier kind. They are then apt to say that the exclusive
members have <i>left</i> the tribe; which, with them, is an undefined and
confused idea, at the best, principally on account of their limited powers of
reflection, and the subject never being alluded to by the others. This
jealousy sometimes leads them to dog these straggling sheep, so that, as far
as lies in their power, they will not allow them to leave, as they imagine,
the Gipsy fold. [See <a href="#Footnote326">second note</a> at page 532.]</p>

<p><a name="Footnote283" id="Footnote283"></a><a href="#FNanchor283"><span class="label">[283]</span></a> I very abruptly addressed a French Gipsy, in the streets of New York,
thus: &#8220;Vous &ecirc;tes un <i>Romany chiel</i>.&#8221; &#8220;Oui, monsieur,&#8221; was the reply
which he, as abruptly, gave me. But, ever afterwards, he got cross, when
I alluded to the subject. On one occasion, I gave him the sign, which he
repeated, while he asked, with much tartness of manner, &#8220;What is that&mdash;what
does it mean?&#8221; This was a roguish Gipsy, and was afterwards lodged
in jail.</p>

<p>On one occasion, I met with a German cutler, in a place of business, in
New York. I felt sure he was a Gipsy, although the world would not have
taken him for one. Catching his eye, I commenced to look around the room,
from those present to himself, as if there was to be something confidential
between us, and then whispered to him, &#8220;<i>Callo chabo</i>,&#8221; (Gipsy, or black fellow;)
and the effect was instantaneous. I afterwards visited his family, on
a Sabbath evening, and took tea with them. They were from Wurtemberg,
and appeared very decent people. The mother, a tall, swarthy, fine looking
intelligent young woman, said grace, which was repeated by the children,
whom I found learning their Sabbath-school lessons. The family
regularly attend church. A fair-haired German called, and went to church
with the Gipsy himself. What with the appearance of everything about
the house, and the fine, clean, and neatly-dressed family of children, I felt
very much pleased with my visit.</p>

<p>French and German Gipsies are very shy, owing to the severity of the
laws against their race.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote284" id="Footnote284"></a><a href="#FNanchor284"><span class="label">[284]</span></a> Fletcher, of Saltoun, speaks of there being constantly a hundred thousand
people in Scotland, leading the life (as Sir Walter Scott describes it,)
of &#8220;Gipsies, Jockies, or Cairds.&#8221; Between the time alluded to and the date
of John Faw&#8217;s league with James V., a period of 140 years had elapsed;
and 174 years from the date of arrival of the race in the country: so that,
from the natural encrease of the body, and the large amount of white blood
introduced into it, the greater part, if not the whole, of the people mentioned,
were doubtless Gipsies. But these Gipsies, according to Sir Walter&#8217;s
opinion, &#8220;died out by a change of habits.&#8221; How strange it is that
the very first class Scottish minds should have so little understood the
philosophy of origin, blood, and descent, and especially as they applied to
the Gipsies! For Sir Walter says: &#8220;The progress of time, and encrease
both of the means of life and the power of the laws, gradually reduced
this dreadful evil within more narrow bounds. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Their numbers are
so greatly diminished, that, instead of one hundred thousand, as calculated
by Fletcher, it would now, perhaps, be impossible to collect above five hundred
throughout all Scotland(!)&#8221; It is perfectly evident that Sir Walter
Scott, in common with many others, never realized the idea, in all its bearings,
of what a Gipsy was; or he never could have imagined that those,
only, were of the Gipsy race, who followed the tent.</p>

<p>It is very doubtful if Anthonius Gawino, and his tribe, departed with
their letter of introduction from James IV. to his uncle, the king of Denmark,
in 1506. Having secured the favour of the king of Scots, by this
recommendatory notice, he was more apt, by delaying his departure, to secure
his position in the country. The circumstances attending the league
with his successor, John Faw, show that the tribe had been long in the
country; doubtless from as far back as 1506. From 1506 till 1579, with
the exception of about one year, during the reign of James V., the tribe, as
I have already said, (<a href="#Page_109">page 109</a>,) must have encreased prodigiously. The
persecutions against the body extended over the reign of James VI., and
part of that of Charles I.; for, according to Baron Hume, such was the
terror which the executions inspired in the tribe, that, &#8220;for the space of more
than 50 years from that time, (1624,) there is no trial of an Egyptian;&#8221;
although our author shows that an execution of a band of them took place
in 1636. But &#8220;towards the end of that century,&#8221; continues Baron Hume,
&#8220;the nuisance seems to have again become troublesome;&#8221; in other words,
that from the reign of Charles I. to the accession of William and Mary,
the time to which Fletcher&#8217;s remark applies, the attention of all being taken
up with the troubles of the times, the Gipsies had things pretty much their
own way; but when peace was restored, they would be called to strict
account.</p>

<p>For all these reasons, it may be said that the 100,000 people spoken of
were doubtless Gipsies of various mixtures of blood; so that, at the present
day, there ought to be a very large number of the tribe in Scotland. I
admit that many of the Scottish Gipsies have been hanged, and many banished
to the Plantations; but these would be in a small ratio to their number,
and a still smaller to the natural encrease of the body. Suppose that
such and such Gipsies were either hanged or banished; so young did they
all marry, that, when they were hanged or banished, they might leave behind
them families ranging from five to ten children. We may say, of the
Scottish Gipsies generally, in days that are past, what a writer in Blackwood&#8217;s
Magazine, already alluded to, said of Billy Marshall: &#8220;Their descendants
were prodigiously numerous; I dare say, numberless.&#8221; Many
of the Scottish Gipsies have migrated to England, as well as elsewhere.
In Liverpool, there are many of them, following various mechanical occupations.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote286" id="Footnote286"></a><a href="#FNanchor286"><span class="label">[286]</span></a> If the real characters of those &#8220;lady fortune-tellers,&#8221; who flourish so
much in the large cities, and publicly profess to reveal all matters in &#8220;love
and law, health and wealth, losses and crosses,&#8221; were to be ascertained,
many of them would, in all probability, be found to belong to a superior
class of Gipsies. And this may much more be said of the more humble
ones, who trust to the gossipping of a class&mdash;and that a respectable class of
females, for the advertising of their calling. For a certainty, those are
Gipsies who stroll about, telling fortunes for dimes, clothes, or old bottles.
The advertising members form a very small part of the fraternity. The
extent to which such business is patronized, by Americans, of both sexes,
and of almost all positions in society is such, that it is doubtful if the
English reader would credit it, if it were put on record.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote287" id="Footnote287"></a><a href="#FNanchor287"><span class="label">[287]</span></a> When travelling on the stage, towards Lake Huron, in Canada, I was
surprised at finding a Gipsy tent on the road-side, with a man sitting in
front of it, engaged in the mysteries of the tinker. I met a camp of Gipsies
on a vacant space, beside a clump of trees, in Hamilton, at the head of
Lake Ontario, but I deferred visiting them till the following morning.
When I returned to the spot, I found that the birds had flown. Feeling
disappointed, I began to question a man who kept a toll-bar, immediately
opposite to where their tents had been, as to their peculiarities generally;
when he said: &#8220;They seemed droll kind o&#8217; folk&mdash;quite like ourselves&mdash;no
way foreign; yet I could not understand a word they were saying among
themselves.&#8221; Shortly after this, a company of them entered a shop, in the
same town, to buy tin, when I happened to be in it. I accosted one of the
mothers of the company, in an abrupt but bland tone. &#8220;You&#8217;re a&#8217; Nawkens
(Gipsies) I see.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Ou ay, we&#8217;re Nawkens,&#8221; was her immediate reply,
accompanied by a smile on her weather-beaten countenance. &#8220;You&#8217;ll aye
speak the language?&#8221; I continued. &#8220;We&#8217;ll ne&#8217;er forget that,&#8221; she again replied.
This seemed to be a company of Gipsies from the Scottish Border;
for the woman spoke about the broadest Scotch I ever heard. They dressed
well, and bore a good reputation in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote288" id="Footnote288"></a><a href="#FNanchor288"><span class="label">[288]</span></a> Mixed Gipsies tell no lies, when they say that they are not Gipsies;
for, physiologically speaking, they are not Gipsies, but only partly Gipsies,
as regards blood. In every other way they are Gipsies, that is, <i>chabos</i>,
<i>calos</i>, or <i>chals</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote289" id="Footnote289"></a><a href="#FNanchor289"><span class="label">[289]</span></a> The people above-mentioned are doubtless Gipsies. According to Grellmann,
the race is even to be found in the centre of Africa. Mollien, in his
travels to the sources of the Senegal and Gambia, in 1818, says: &#8220;Scattered
among the Joloffs, we find a people not unlike our Gipsies, and known
by the name of Laaub&eacute;s. Leading a roving life, and without fixed habitation,
their only employment is the manufacture of wooden vessels, mortars,
and bedsteads. They choose a well-wooded spot, fell some trees, form huts
with the branches, and work up the trunks. For this privilege, they must
pay a sort of tax to the prince in whose states they thus settle. In general,
they are both ugly and slovenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The women, notwithstanding their almost frightful faces, are covered
with amber and coral beads, presents heaped on them by the Joloffs, from
a notion that the favours, alone, of these women will be followed by those of
fortune. Ugly or handsome, all the young Laaub&eacute; females are in request
among the Negroes.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Laaub&eacute;s have nothing of their own but their money, their tools,
and their asses; the only animals on which they travel. In the woods,
they make fires with the dung of the flocks. Ranged round the fires, the
men and women pass their leisure time in smoking. The Laaub&eacute;s have not
those characteristic features and high stature which mark the Joloffs, and
they seem to form a distinct race. They are exempted from all military
service. Each family has its chief, but, over all, there is a superior chief,
who commands a whole tribe or nation. He collects the tribute, and communicates
with such delegates of the king as receive the imposts: this
serves to protect them from all vexation. The Laaub&eacute;s are idolaters, speak
the Poula language, and pretend to tell fortunes.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote290" id="Footnote290"></a><a href="#FNanchor290"><span class="label">[290]</span></a> Bell, in an account of his journey to Pekin, [1721.] says that upwards
of sixty Gipsies had arrived at Tobolsky, on their way to China, but were
stopped by the Vice-Governor, for want of passports. They had roamed,
during the summer season, from Poland, in small parties, subsisting by
selling trinkets, and telling fortunes.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote291" id="Footnote291"></a><a href="#FNanchor291"><span class="label">[291]</span></a> Mr. Borrow says, with reference to the Spanish Gipsy language: &#8220;Its
grammatical peculiarities have disappeared, the entire language having
been modified and subjected to the rules of Spanish grammar, with which
it now coincides in syntax, in the conjugation of verbs, and in the declension
of its nouns.&#8221; We might have naturally expected that of the Gipsy language,
in the course of four hundred years, from the people speaking it being
so much scattered over the country, and coming so much in contact
with the ordinary natives. But something different might be looked for,
where the Gipsies have not been persecuted, but allowed to live together
in a body, as in Hungary. Of the Hungarian Gipsy language, Mr. Borrow
says, that in no part of the world is the Gipsy language better preserved
than in Hungary; and that the roving bands of Gipsies from that country,
who visit France and Italy, speak the pure Gipsy, with all its grammatical
peculiarities. He estimates that the Spanish Gipsy language may consist
of four or five thousand words; a sufficient number, one might suppose, to
serve the purpose of everyday life. A late writer in the Dublin University
Magazine estimates that five thousand words would serve the same purpose
in the English language. Four thousand words is a very large language for
the Gipsies of Spain to possess, in addition to the ordinary one of the country.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote292" id="Footnote292"></a><a href="#FNanchor292"><span class="label">[292]</span></a> I cannot agree with Mr. Borrow, when he says, that the Gipsies
&#8220;travelled three thousand miles into Europe, <i>with hatred in their hearts
towards the people among whom they settled</i>.&#8221; In none of the earliest laws
passed against them, is anything said of their being other than thieves,
cheats, &amp;c., &amp;c. They seem to have been too politic to commit murder;
moreover, it appears to have been foreign to their disposition to do aught
but obtain a living in the most cunning manner they could. There is no
necessary connection between purloining one&#8217;s property and hating one&#8217;s
person. As long as the Gipsies were not hardly dealt with, they could,
naturally, have no actual hatred towards their fellow-creatures. Mr. Borrow
attributes none of the spite and hatred of the race towards the community
to the severity of the persecutions to which it was exposed, or to
that hard feeling with which society has regarded it. These, and the example
of the Spaniards, doubtless led the Gitanos to shed the blood of the
ordinary natives.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote293" id="Footnote293"></a><a href="#FNanchor293"><span class="label">[293]</span></a> I accidentally got into conversation with an Irishman, in the city of
New York, about secret societies, when he mentioned that he was a member
of a great many such, indeed, &#8220;all of them,&#8221; as he expressed it. I said
there was one society of which he was not a member, when he began to
enumerate them, and at last came to the Zincali. &#8220;What,&#8221; said I, &#8220;are you a
member of this society?&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he; &#8220;the Zincali, or Gipsy.&#8221; He then told
me that there are many members of this society in the city of New York;
not all members of it, under that name, but of its outposts, if I may so express
it. The principal or arch-Gipsy for the city, he said, was a merchant,
in &mdash;&mdash; street, who had in his possession a printed vocabulary, or
dictionary, of the language, which was open only to the most thoroughly
initiated. In the course of our conversation, it fell out that the native
American Gipsy referred to at <a href="#Page_420">page 420</a> was one of the thoroughly initiated;
which circumstance explained a question he had put to me, and which I
evaded, by saying that I was not in the habit of telling tales out of school.</p>

<p>In Spain, as we have seen, a Gipsy taught her language to her son from
a MS. I doubt not there are MS. if not printed, vocabularies of the Gipsy
language among the tribe in Scotland, as well as in other countries.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote294" id="Footnote294"></a><a href="#FNanchor294"><span class="label">[294]</span></a> Among the various means by which the name of Gipsy can be raised
up, it may be mentioned, that beginning the word with a capital is one of
no little importance. The almost invariable custom with writers, in that
respect, has been as if they were describing rats and mice, instead of a race
of men.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote295" id="Footnote295"></a><a href="#FNanchor295"><span class="label">[295]</span></a> This sensation, in the minds of the Gipsies, of the perpetuity of their
race, creates, in a great measure, its immortality. Paradoxical as it may
appear, the way to preserve the existence of a people is to scatter it, provided,
however, that it is a race thoroughly distinct from others, to commence
with. When, by the force of circumstances, it has fairly settled
down into the idea that it is a people, those living in one country become
conscious of its existence in others; and hence arises the principal cause of
the perpetuity of its existence as a scattered people.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote296" id="Footnote296"></a><a href="#FNanchor296"><span class="label">[296]</span></a> The fact of these Indians, and the aboriginal races found in the countries
colonised by Europeans, disappearing so rapidly, prevents our regarding
them with any great degree of interest. This circumstance detracts
from that idea of dignity which the perpetuity and civilization of their race
would inspire in the minds of others.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote297" id="Footnote297"></a><a href="#FNanchor297"><span class="label">[297]</span></a> A writer in the Penny Cyclop&aelig;dia illustrates this absurd idea, in very
plain terms, when he says: &#8220;In England, the Gipsies have much diminished,
of late years, in consequence of the enclosure of lands, and the laws
against vagrants.&#8221; Sir Walter Scott&#8217;s idea of the Gipsies has been followed
in a pictorial history of Scotland, lately issued from the Scottish
press.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote298" id="Footnote298"></a><a href="#FNanchor298"><span class="label">[298]</span></a> The following singular remarks appeared in a very late number of
Chambers&#8217; Journal, on the subject of the Gipsies of the Danube: &#8220;As the
wild cat, the otter, and the wolf, generally disappear before the advance of
civilization, the wild races of mankind are, in like manner and degree, gradually
coming to an end, and from the same causes(!) The waste lands get
enclosed, the woods are cut down, the police becomes yearly more efficient,
and the Pariahs vanish with their means of subsistence. [Where do they
go to?] In England, there are, at most, 1,500 Gipsies(!) Before the end
of the present century, they will probably be extinct over Western Europe(!)&#8221;</p>

<p>It is perfectly evident that the world, outside of Gipsydom, has to be
initiated in the subject of the Gipsies, as in the first principles of a science,
or as a child is instructed in its alphabet. And yet, the above-mentioned
writer takes upon himself to chide Mr. Borrow, in the matter of the Gipsies.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote299" id="Footnote299"></a><a href="#FNanchor299"><span class="label">[299]</span></a> I leave out of view various scattered nations in Asia.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote300" id="Footnote300"></a><a href="#FNanchor300"><span class="label">[300]</span></a> It is interesting to hear the Gipsies speak of their race &#8220;taking of&#8221;
this or the other race. Said an English Gipsy, to me, with reference to some
Gipsies of whom we were speaking: &#8220;They take of the Arabians.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote301" id="Footnote301"></a><a href="#FNanchor301"><span class="label">[301]</span></a> There is scarce a part of the habitable world where they are not to be
found; their tents are alike pitched on the heaths of Brazil and the ridges
of the Himalayan hills; and their language is heard at Moscow and Madrid,
in the streets of London and Stamboul. They are found in all parts of
Russia, with the exception of the Government of St. Petersburg, from which
they have been banished. In most of the provincial towns, they are to be
found in a state of half civilization, supporting themselves by trafficking in
horses, or by curing the disorders incidental to those animals. But the vast
majority reject this manner of life, and traverse the country in bands, like
the ancient Hamaxobioi; the immense grassy plains of Russia affording
pasturage for their herds of cattle, on which, and the produce of the chase,
they chiefly depend for subsistence.&mdash;<i>Borrow.</i></p>

<p><a name="Footnote302" id="Footnote302"></a><a href="#FNanchor302"><span class="label">[302]</span></a> Considering what is popularly understood to be the natural disposition
and capacity of the Gipsies, we would readily conclude that to turn innkeepers
would be the most unlikely of all their employments; yet that is
very common. Mahommed said, &#8220;If the mountain will not come to us, we
will go to the mountain.&#8221; The Gipsies say, &#8220;If we do not go to the people,
the people must come to us;&#8221; and so they open their houses of entertainment.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote303" id="Footnote303"></a><a href="#FNanchor303"><span class="label">[303]</span></a> The following is a description of a superior Spanish Gipsy, in 1584, as
quoted by Mr. Borrow, from the memoirs of a Spaniard, who had seen
him: &#8220;At this time, they had a count, a fellow who spoke the Castilian
idiom with as much purity as if he had been a native of Toledo. He was
acquainted with all the ports of Spain, and all the difficult and broken
ground of the provinces. He knew the exact strength of every city, and
who were the principal people in each, and the exact amount of their
property; there was nothing relative to the state, however secret, that he
was not acquainted with; nor did he make a mystery of his knowledge, but
publicly boasted of it.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote304" id="Footnote304"></a><a href="#FNanchor304"><span class="label">[304]</span></a> I should suppose that this was Captain Gordon who behaved himself
like a prince, at the North Queensferry. <i>See <a href="#Page_172">page 172</a>.</i></p>

<p><a name="Footnote305" id="Footnote305"></a><a href="#FNanchor305"><span class="label">[305]</span></a> The only part of the religion of the Jews having an origin prior to the
establishment of the Mosaic law was circumcision, which was termed the
covenant made by God with Abraham and his seed. (Gen. xvii. 10-14.)
The abolition of idols, and the worship of God alone, are presumed, although
not expressed. The Jews lapsed into gross idolatry while in Egypt, but
were not likely to neglect circumcision, as that was necessary to maintain
a physical uniformity among the race, but did not enter into the wants,
and hopes, and fears, inherent in the human breast, and stimulated by the
daily exhibition of the phenomena of its existence. The second table of
the moral law was, of course, written upon the hearts of the Jews, in common
with those of the Gentiles. (Rom. ii. 14, 15.)</p>

<p><a name="Footnote306" id="Footnote306"></a><a href="#FNanchor306"><span class="label">[306]</span></a> It is an unnecessary stretch upon the belief in the Scriptures, to ask
consent to the abstract proposition that the Jews, while in Egypt, encreased
from seventy souls to &#8220;about six hundred thousand on foot that were men,
besides children,&#8221; at the time of the Exodus. Following a pastoral life, in
a healthy and fertile country, and inspired with the prophecy delivered to
Abraham, as to his numberless descendants, the whole bent of the mind of
the Jews was to multiply their numbers; and polygamy and concubinage
being characteristic of the people, there is no reason to doubt that the
Jews encreased to the number stated. The original emigrants, doubtless,
took with them large establishments of bondmen and bondwomen, and
purchased others while in Egypt; and these being circumcised, according
to the covenant made with Abraham, would sooner or later become, on
that account alone, part of the nation; and much more so by such amalgamation
as is set forth by Rachel and Leah giving their maids to Jacob
to have children by them. Abraham was, at best, the representative head
of the Jewish nation, composed, as that was originally, of elements drawn
from the idolatrous tribes surrounding him and his descendants.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote307" id="Footnote307"></a><a href="#FNanchor307"><span class="label">[307]</span></a> Tacitus gives the following glowing account of the destruction of the
Druids, in the island of Anglesey: &#8220;On the opposite shore stood the Britons,
closely embodied, and prepared for action. Women were seen rushing
through the ranks in wild disorder; their apparel funereal; their hair
loose to the wind, in their hands flaming torches, and their whole appearance
resembling the frantic rage of the Furies. The Druids were ranged
in order, with hands uplifted, invoking the gods, and pouring forth horrible
imprecations. The novelty of the sight struck the Romans with awe and
terror. They stood in stupid amazement, as if their limbs were benumbed,
riveted to one spot, a mark for the enemy. The exhortation of the general
diffused new vigour through the ranks, and the men, by mutual reproaches,
inflamed each other to deeds of valour. They felt the disgrace of yielding
to a troop of women, and a band of fanatic priests; they advanced their
standards, and rushed on to the attack with impetuous fury. The Britons
perished in the flames which they themselves had kindled. The island
fell, and a garrison was established to retain it in subjection. <i>The religious
groves, dedicated to superstition and barbarous rites, were levelled to the ground.
In those recesses, the natives imbrued their altars with the blood of their prisoners,
and, in the entrails of men, explored the will of the gods.</i>&#8220;&mdash;<i>Murphy&#8217;s
Translation.</i></p>

<p><a name="Footnote308" id="Footnote308"></a><a href="#FNanchor308"><span class="label">[308]</span></a> It would almost seem that the Gipsies are the people mentioned in Deut.
xxxii. 21, and Rom. x. 19, where it is said: &#8220;I will provoke you, (the
Jews,) to jealousy, by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I
will anger you.&#8221; For the history of the Gipsy nation thoroughly burlesques
that of the Jews. But the Jews will be very apt to ignore the existence
of the present work, should the rest of the world allow them to do
it. Yet, excepting the Gipsies themselves, none are so capable of understanding
this subject as the Jews, there being so much in it that is applicable
to themselves.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote309" id="Footnote309"></a><a href="#FNanchor309"><span class="label">[309]</span></a> This information I obtained from some English Gipsies. Thereafter,
the title of the following work came under my notice: &#8220;Historical Researches
Respecting the Sojourn of the Heathens, or Egyptians, in the
Northern Netherlands. By J. Dirks. Edited by the Provincial Utrecht
Society of Arts and Sciences. Utrecht: 1850. pp. viii. and 160.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed, the Gipsies are scattered all over Europe, and are to be found in
the condition described in the present work.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote310" id="Footnote310"></a><a href="#FNanchor310"><span class="label">[310]</span></a> There are, probably, 12,000,000 of Jews in the world. I have seen
them estimated at from ten to twelve millions. It is impossible to obtain
anything like a correct number of the Jews, in almost <i>any</i> country, leaving
out of view the immense numbers scattered over the world, and living even
in parts unexplored by Europeans.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote311" id="Footnote311"></a><a href="#FNanchor311"><span class="label">[311]</span></a> It is astonishing how superficially some passages of Scripture are interpreted.
There is, for instance, the conduct of Gamaliel, before the Jewish
council. (Acts v. 17-40.) The advice given by him, as a Pharisee, was
nothing but a piece of specious party clap-trap, to discomfit a Sadducee.
St. Paul, who was brought up at the feet of this Pharisee, and, doubtless,
well versed in the factious tactics of his party, gives a beautiful commentary
on the action of his old master, when, on being brought before the same
tribunal, and perceiving that his enemies embraced both parties, he set
them by the ears, by proclaiming himself a Pharisee, and raising the question,
(the &#8220;hope and resurrection of the dead,&#8221;) on which they so bitterly
disagreed. (Acts xxiii. 6-10.) There was much adroitness displayed by
the Apostle, in so turning the wrath of his enemies against themselves, after
having inadvertently reviled the high priest, in their presence, and within
one of the holy places, in such language as the following: &#8220;God shall smite
thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest
me to be smitten, contrary to the law.&#8221; As it was, he was only
saved from being &#8220;pulled in pieces&#8221; by his blood-thirsty persecutors&mdash;the
one sect attacking, and the other defending him&mdash;by a company of Roman
soldiers, dispatched to take him by force from among them. Nothing could
be more specious than Gamaliel&#8217;s reasoning, for it could apply to almost
anything, and was well suited to the feelings of a divided and excited assembly;
or have less foundation, according to his theory, for the very steps
which he advised the people against adopting, for the suppression of Christians,
were used to destroy the false Messiahs to whom he referred. And
yet people quote this recorded clap-trap of an old Pharisee, as an inspiration,
for the guidance of private Christians, and Christian magistrates!</p>

<p><a name="Footnote312" id="Footnote312"></a><a href="#FNanchor312"><span class="label">[312]</span></a> Tacitus makes Caius Cassius, in the time of Nero, say: &#8220;At present,
we have in our service whole nations of slaves, the scum of mankind, collected
from all quarters of the globe; a race of men who bring with them
foreign rites, and the religion of their country, <i>or, probably, no religion at
all</i>.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Murphy&#8217;s Translation.</i></p>

<p><a name="Footnote313" id="Footnote313"></a><a href="#FNanchor313"><span class="label">[313]</span></a> The following extract from &#8220;Leaves from the Diary of a Jewish Minister,&#8221;
published in the above-mentioned journal, on the 4th April, 1862,
may not be uninteresting to the Christian reader:</p>

<p>&#8220;In our day, the conscience of Israel is seldom troubled; it is of so elastic
a character, that, like gutta percha, it stretches and is compressed, according
to the desire of its owner. We seldom hear of a troubled conscience. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Not
that we would assert that our people are without a conscience;
we merely state that we seldom hear of its troubles. It is more
than probable, that when the latent feeling is aroused on matters of religion,
and for a moment they have an idea that &#8216;their soul is not well,&#8217; they take
a hom&oelig;opathic dose of spiritual medicine, and then feel quite convalescent.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote315" id="Footnote315"></a><a href="#FNanchor315"><span class="label">[315]</span></a> <i>Petul</i>, according to Mr. Borrow, means a horse-shoe; and <i>Petulengro</i>,
a lord of the horse-shoe. It is evidently a very high catch-word among
the English Gipsies.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote316" id="Footnote316"></a><a href="#FNanchor316"><span class="label">[316]</span></a> Various of the characters mentioned in Mr. Borrow&#8217;s &#8220;Lavengro,&#8221;
and &#8220;Romany Rye,&#8221; are, beyond doubt, Gipsies. Old Fulcher is termed,
in a derisive manner, by Ursula, &#8220;a <i>gorgio</i> and basket-maker.&#8221; She is one
of the Hernes; a family which <i>gorgio</i> and basket-maker Gipsies describe
as &#8220;an ignorant, conceited set, who think nothing of other Gipsies, owing
to the quality and quantity of their own blood.&#8221; This is the manner in
which the more original and pure and the other kind of English Gipsies
frequently talk of each other. The latter will deny that they are Gipsies,
at least hide it from the world; and, like the same kind of Scottish Gipsies,
speak of the others, exclusively, as Gipsies. I am acquainted with a fair-haired
English Gipsy, whose wife, now dead, was a half-breed. &#8220;But I
am not a Gipsy,&#8221; said he to me, very abruptly, before I had said anything
that could have induced him to think that I took him for one. He spoke
Gipsy, like the others. I soon caught him tripping; for, in speaking of
the size of Gipsy families, he slipped his foot, and said: &#8220;For example,
there is our family; there were (so many) of us.&#8221; There is another Gipsy,
a neighbour, who passes his wife off to the public as an Irish woman, while
she is a fair-haired Irish Gipsy. Both, in short, played upon the word
Gipsy; for, as regards fullness of blood, they really were not Gipsies.</p>

<p>The dialogue between the Romany Rye and the Horncastle jockey clearly
shows the Gipsy in the latter, when his attention is directed to the figure
of the Hungarian. The Romany Rye makes indirect reference to the Gipsies,
and the jockey abruptly asks: &#8220;Who be they? Come, don&#8217;t be
ashamed. I have occasionally kept queerish company myself.&#8221; &#8220;Romany
<i>chals</i>! Whew! I begin to smell a rat.&#8221; The remainder of the dialogue,
and the <i>spree</i> which follows, are perfectly Gipsy throughout, on the part of
the jockey; but, like so many of his race, he is evidently ashamed to own
himself up to be &#8220;one of them.&#8221; He says, in a way as if he were a
stranger to the language: &#8220;And what a singular language they have got!&#8221;
&#8220;Do you know anything of it?&#8221; said the Romany Rye. &#8220;Only a very few
words; they were always chary in teaching me any.&#8221; He said he was
brought up with the <i>gorgio</i> and basket-maker Fulcher, who followed the
caravan. He is described as dressed in a coat of green, (a favourite Gipsy
colour,) and as having curly brown or black hair; and he says of Mary
Fulcher, whom he married: &#8220;She had a fair complexion, and nice red hair,
both of which I liked, being a bit of a black myself.&#8221; How much this is in
keeping with the Gipsies, who so frequently speak of each other, in a
jocular way, as &#8220;brown and black rascals!&#8221;</p>

<p>I likewise claim Isopel Berners, in Lavengro, to be a <i>thumping</i> Gipsy
lass, who travelled the country with her donkey-cart, taking her own part,
and <i>wapping</i> this one, and <i>wapping</i> that one. It signifies not what her appearance
was. I have frequently taken tea, at her house, with a young,
blue-eyed, English Gipsy widow, perfectly English in her appearance, who
spoke Gipsy freely enough. It did not signify what Isopel said of herself,
or her relations. How did she come to speak Gipsy? Do Gipsies <i>teach</i>
their language to <i>strangers</i>, and, more especially, to strange women? Assuredly
not. Suppose that Isopel was not a Gipsy, but had married a
Gipsy, then I could understand how she might have known Gipsy, and yet
not have been a Gipsy, except by initiation. But it is utterly improbable
that she, a strange woman, should have been taught a word of it.</p>

<p>In England are to be found Gipsies of many occupations; horse-dealers,
livery stable-keepers, public-house keepers, sometimes grocers and linen-drapers;
indeed, almost every occupation from these downwards. I can
readily enough believe an English Gipsy, when he tells me, that he knows
of an English squire a Gipsy. To have an English squire a Gipsy, might
have come about even in this way: Imagine a rollicking or eccentric English
squire taking up with, and marrying, say, a pretty mixed Gipsy bar or
lady&#8217;s maid, and the children would be brought up Gipsies, for certainty.</p>

<p>There are two Gipsies, of the name of B&mdash;&mdash;, farmers upon the estate
of Lord Lister, near Massingham, in the county of Norfolk. They are described
as good-sized, handsome men, and swarthy, with long black hair,
combed over their shoulders. They dress in the old Gipsy stylish fashion,
with a green cut-away, or Newmarket, coat, yellow leather breeches, buttoned
to the knee, and top boots, with a Gipsy hat, ruffled breast, and
turned-down collar. They occupy the position of any natives in society;
attend church, take an interest in parish matters, dine with his lordship&#8217;s
other tenants, and compete for prizes at the agricultural shows. They are
proud of being Gipsies. I have also been told that there are Gipsies in the
county of Kent, who have hop farms and dairies.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote317" id="Footnote317"></a><a href="#FNanchor317"><span class="label">[317]</span></a> Bunyan adds: &#8220;But, notwithstanding the meanness and inconsiderableness
of my parents, it pleased God to put it into their hearts to put me to
school, to learn me both to read and write; the which I also attained, according
to the rate of other poor men&#8217;s children.&#8221;</p>

<p>He does not say, &#8220;According to the rate of poor men&#8217;s children,&#8221; but of
&#8220;<i>other</i> poor men&#8217;s children:&#8221; a form of expression always used by the Gipsies
when speaking of themselves, as distinguished from others. The language
used by Bunyan, in speaking of his family, was in harmony with
that of the population at large; but he, doubtless, had the feelings peculiar
to all the tribe, with reference to their origin and race.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote318" id="Footnote318"></a><a href="#FNanchor318"><span class="label">[318]</span></a> Justice Keeling threatened Bunyan with this fate, even for preaching;
for said he: &#8220;If you do not submit to go to hear divine service, and leave
your preaching, you must be banished the realm: And if, after such a day
as shall be appointed you to be gone, you shall be found in this realm, or
be found to come over again, without special license from the king, you
must stretch by the neck for it. I tell you plainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Matthew Hale tells us that, on one occasion, at the Suffolk assizes, no
less than thirteen Gipsies were executed, under the old Gipsy statutes, a
few years before the Restoration.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote319" id="Footnote319"></a><a href="#FNanchor319"><span class="label">[319]</span></a> Perhaps the following passage is the one alluded to by this writer: &#8220;I
often, when these temptations had been with force upon me, did compare
myself to the case of such a child, whom some Gipsy hath by force took
up in her arms, and is carrying from friend and country.&#8221; <i>Grace abounding.</i>
The use of a simile like this confirms the fact that Bunyan belonged
to the tribe, rather than that he did not; unless we can imagine that Gipsies,
when candid, do not what every other race has done&mdash;admit the peculiarities
of theirs, while in a previous and barbarous state of existence. His
admission confirms a fact generally believed, but sometimes denied, as in
the case of the writer in Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine, mentioned at <a href="#Page_375">page 375</a>.</p>

<p>Bunyan, doubtless, &#8220;dwelt on it with a sort of spiritual exultation,&#8221; that
he should have been &#8220;called&#8221;&mdash;not &#8220;out of Egypt,&#8221; but&mdash;&#8220;out of the
tribe,&#8221; when, possibly, no others of it, to his knowledge, had been so privileged;
but it was, certainly, &#8220;most unlikely&#8221; he would say that &#8220;he
belonged to that class of vagabonds.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote320" id="Footnote320"></a><a href="#FNanchor320"><span class="label">[320]</span></a> It is interesting to notice what these two writers say. If Bunyan&#8217;s
father was a Gipsy, we may reasonably assume that his mother was one
likewise; and, consequently, that Bunyan was one himself, or as Sir Walter
Scott expresses it&mdash;a &#8220;Gipsy reclaimed.&#8221; A Gipsy being a question of
race, and not a matter of habits, it should be received as one of the simplest
of elementary truths, that once a Gipsy, always a Gipsy. We naturally
ask, Why has not the fact of Bunyan having been a Gipsy stood on record,
for the last two centuries? and, echo answers, Why?</p>

<p><a name="Footnote321" id="Footnote321"></a><a href="#FNanchor321"><span class="label">[321]</span></a> Although Bunyan probably never anticipated being held in high estimation
by what are termed the &#8220;great ones&#8221; of the earth, yet what Southey
has said cannot be predicated of him, if we consider the singularity of his
origin and history, and the popularity which he enjoyed, as author of the
Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress; a work affecting the mind of man in every age of the
world. Of this work Bunyan writes:</p>

<div class="poem" style="font-size: 90%;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;My Pilgrim&#8217;s book has travelled sea and land,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yet more, so public doth my Pilgrim walk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That of him thousands daily sing and talk.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><a name="Footnote322" id="Footnote322"></a><a href="#FNanchor322"><span class="label">[322]</span></a> Bunsen writes: &#8220;Sound judgment is displayed rather in an aptness
for believing what is historical, than in a readiness at denying it. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Shallow minds have a decided propensity to fall into the latter error. Incapability
of believing on evidence is the last form of the intellectual imbecility
of an enervated age.&#8221;</p>

<p>A writer who contributes frequently to &#8220;Notes and Queries,&#8221; after stating
that he has read the works of Grellmann and Hoyland on the Gipsies,
adds: &#8220;My conclusion is that the tribes have no more right to nationality,
race, blood, or language, than the London thieves have&mdash;with their slang,
some words of which may have their origin in the Hebrew, from their
dealings with the lowest order of Jews.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote323" id="Footnote323"></a><a href="#FNanchor323"><span class="label">[323]</span></a> That the rabble, or &#8220;fellows of the baser sort,&#8221; should have pelted
Bunyan with all sorts of offensive articles, when he commenced to preach
the gospel, is what could naturally have been expected; but it sounds
strange to read what he has put on record of the abuse heaped upon him,
by people professing to be the servants of Him &#8220;in whom there is neither
Jew nor Greek, bond nor free, male nor female.&#8221; See with what Christian
humility he alludes to such treatment, as contrasted with the manly indignation
which he displayed in repelling slanders. He speaks of &#8220;the Lord
wiping off such insults at his coming;&#8221; when his enemies, with the utmost
familiarity and assurance, may approach the judgment-seat, and demand
their crowns. &#8220;Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in
thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful
works?&#8221; And it may be answered unto them: &#8220;I never knew you; depart
from me, ye that work iniquity.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote324" id="Footnote324"></a><a href="#FNanchor324"><span class="label">[324]</span></a> It is interesting to compare this feeling with that of the lowest order
of Spaniards, as described by Mr. Borrow. &#8220;The outcast of the prison and
the <i>presidio</i>, who calls himself Spaniard, would feel insulted by being termed
Gitano, and would thank God that he is not.&#8221; <i><a href="#Page_386">Page 386</a>.</i></p>

<p><a name="Footnote325" id="Footnote325"></a><a href="#FNanchor325"><span class="label">[325]</span></a> Let us suppose that a person, who has read all the works that have
hitherto appeared on the Gipsies, and noticed the utter absence, in them,
of everything of the nature of a philosophy of the subject, thoroughly
masters all that is set forth in the present work. The knowledge which he
<i>then</i> possesses puts him in such a position, that he approximates to being
one of the tribe, himself; that is, if all that is contained therein be known
to him and the tribe, only, it would enable him to pass current, in certain
circles of Gipsydom, as one of themselves.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote326" id="Footnote326"></a><a href="#FNanchor326"><span class="label">[326]</span></a> There is a point which I have not explained so fully as I might have
done, and it is this: &#8220;Is any of the blood <i>ever lost</i>? that is, does it <i>ever
cease to be Gipsy</i>, in knowledge and feeling?&#8221; That is a question not easily
answered in the affirmative, were it only for this reason: how can it ever
be ascertained that the knowledge and feeling of being Gipsies become
lost? Let us suppose that a couple of Gipsies leave England, and settle in
America, and that they never come in contact with any of their race, and
that their children never learn anything of the matter from any quarter.
(<a href="#Page_413">Page 413</a>.) In such an extreme, I may say, such an unnatural, case,
the children would not be Gipsies, but, if born in America, ordinary Americans.
The only way in which the Gipsy blood&mdash;that is, the Gipsy feeling&mdash;can
possibly be lost, is by a Gipsy, (a man especially,) marrying an ordinary
native, (<a href="#Page_381">page 381</a>,) and the children never learning of the circumstance.
But, as I have said before, how is that ever to be ascertained?
The question might be settled in this way: Let the relatives of the Gipsy
interrogate the issue, and if it answers, <i>truly,</i> that it knows nothing of the
Gipsy connexion, and never has its curiosity in the matter excited, it holds,
beyond dispute, that &#8220;the blood&#8221; has been lost to the tribe. For any loss
the tribe may sustain, in that way, it gains, in an ample degree, by drawing
upon the blood of the native race, and transmuting it into that of its
own fraternity.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote327" id="Footnote327"></a><a href="#FNanchor327"><span class="label">[327]</span></a> It was the nature of man, in ancient times, as it is with the heathen
to-day, to <i>worship</i> what could not be understood; while modern civilization
seems to attribute such phenomena to <i>miracles</i>. It is even presumptuous
to have recourse to such an alternative, for the enquirer may be deficient
in the intellect necessary to prosecute such investigations, or he may
not be in possession of sufficient data. If the European will, for example,
ask himself, 1stly: what is the idea which he has of a Gipsy? 2ndly:
what are the feelings which he entertains for him personally? And 3dly:
what must be the response of the Gipsy to the sentiments of the other?
he cannot avoid coming to the conclusion, that the race should &#8220;marry
among themselves,&#8221; and that, &#8220;let them be in whatever situation of life
they may, they all&#8221; should &#8220;stick to each other.&#8221; (<i><a href="#Page_369">Page 369</a>.</i>)</p>

<p><a name="Footnote328" id="Footnote328"></a><a href="#FNanchor328"><span class="label">[328]</span></a> Viewing the Gipsies as they are described in this work, and contrasting
their history with that of the nations of the world in general, and the Jews
in particular, and considering that they have no religion peculiar to themselves,
yet are scattered among, and worked into, all nations, but not acknowledged
by, or even known to, others, we may, with the utmost
propriety, call them, in the language of the prophet, &#8220;no people,&#8221; and a &#8220;foolish
nation;&#8221; yet by no means a nation of fools, but rather more rogues than
fools. Of all the ways in which the Gipsies have hoaxed other people, the
manner in which they have managed to throw around themselves a sense
of their non-existence to the minds of others, is the most remarkable.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote329" id="Footnote329"></a><a href="#FNanchor329"><span class="label">[329]</span></a> The prejudice of their fellow-creatures is a sufficiently potent cause,
in itself, to preserve the identity of the Gipsy tribe in the world. It has
made it to resemble an essence, hermetically sealed. Keep it in that position,
and it retains its inherent qualities undiminished; but uncork the
vessel containing it, and it might (I do not say it <i>would</i>) evaporate among
the surrounding elements.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote330" id="Footnote330"></a><a href="#FNanchor330"><span class="label">[330]</span></a> The MS. of this work has undergone many vicissitudes. Among others,
it may be mentioned that, in the state in which it was left by the author,
it was twice lost, and once stolen; on which last occasion it was recovered,
at an expense of one shilling! Then the original copy, in its present form,
was stolen, and never recovered. In both instances did that happen under
circumstances that such a fate was most unlikely to befall it. Then a copy
of it was sent to Scotland, and never acknowledged, although I am in hopes
it is now on its return, after a lapse of nearly three years; in which
case, I will be more fortunate than the author, who gave the MS. to an
individual and never got, and never could get, it back.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
